    "text": "Cover story in the Economist this week. Very big issue when I was in Japan and Korea. Korean parliamentarians want to get women and economic growth on the G20 agenda when they have the lead next year and we are advocating for Japan to advance the issue at APEC which they are leading this year.\n\nOn another note, so sad about Smith Bagley. He was a good person and was one of your biggest fans.\n\nWomen and work\n\nWe did it!\n\nDec 30th 2009\nFrom The Economist print edition\n\nThe rich world's quiet revolution: women are gradually taking over the workplace\n\nGetty Images\n\nAT A time when the world is short of causes for celebration, here is a candidate: within the next few months women will cross the 50% threshold and become the majority of the American workforce. Women already make up the majority of university graduates in the OECD countries and the majority of professional workers in several rich countries, including the United States. Women run many of the world's great companies, from PepsiCo in America to Areva in France.\n\nWomen's economic empowerment is arguably the biggest social change of our times. Just a generation ago, women were largely confined to repetitive, menial jobs. They were routinely subjected to casual sexism and were expected to abandon their careers when they married and had children. Today they are running some of the organisations that once treated them as second-class citizens. Millions of women have been given more control over their own lives. And millions of brains have been put to more productive use. Societies that try to resist this trend-most notably the Arab countries, but also Japan and some southern European countries-will pay a heavy price in the form of wasted talent and frustrated citizens.\n\nThis revolution has been achieved with only a modicum of friction (see article). Men have, by and large, welcomed women's invasion of the workplace. Yet even the most positive changes can be incomplete or unsatisfactory. This particular advance comes with two stings. The first is that women are still under-represented at the top of companies. Only 2% of the bosses of America's largest companies and 5% of their peers in Britain are women. They are also paid significantly less than men on average. The second is that juggling work and child-rearing is difficult. Middle-class couples routinely complain that they have too little time for their children. But the biggest losers are poor children-particularly in places like America and Britain that have combined high levels of female participation in the labour force with a reluctance to spend public money on child care.\n\nDealing with the juggle\n\nThese two problems are closely related. Many women feel they have to choose between their children and their careers. Women who prosper in high-pressure companies during their 20s drop out in dramatic numbers in their 30s and then find it almost impossible to regain their earlier momentum. Less-skilled women are trapped in poorly paid jobs with hand-to-mouth child-care arrangements. Motherhood, not sexism, is the issue: in America, childless women earn almost as much as men, but mothers earn significantly less. And those mothers' relative poverty also disadvantages their children.\n\nDemand for female brains is helping to alleviate some of these problems. Even if some of the new theories about warm-hearted women making inherently superior workers are bunk (see article), several trends favour the more educated sex, including the \"war for talent\" and the growing flexibility of the workplace. Law firms, consultancies and banks are rethinking their \"up or out\" promotion systems because they are losing so many able women. More than 90% of companies in Germany and Sweden allow flexible working. And new technology is making it easier to redesign work in all sorts of family-friendly ways.\n\nWomen have certainly performed better over the past decade than men. In the European Union women have filled 6m of the 8m new jobs created since 2000. In America three out of four people thrown out of work since the \"mancession\" began have been male. And the shift towards women is likely to continue: by 2011 there will be 2.6m more female than male university students in America.\n\nThe light hand of the state\n\nAll this argues, mostly, for letting the market do the work. That has not stopped calls for hefty state intervention of the Scandinavian sort. Norway has used threats of quotas to dramatic effect. Some 40% of the legislators there are women. All the Scandinavian countries provide plenty of state-financed nurseries. They have the highest levels of female employment in the world and far fewer of the social problems that plague Britain and America. Surely, comes the argument, there is a way to speed up the revolution-and improve the tough lives of many working women and their children?\n\nIf that means massive intervention, in the shape of affirmative-action programmes and across-the-board benefits for parents of all sorts, the answer is no. To begin with, promoting people on the basis of their sex is illiberal and unfair, and stigmatises its beneficiaries. And there are practical problems. Lengthy periods of paid maternity leave can put firms off hiring women, which helps explain why most Swedish women work in the public sector and Sweden has a lower proportion of women in management than America does.\n\nBut there are plenty of cheaper, subtler ways in which governments can make life easier for women. Welfare states were designed when most women stayed at home. They need to change the way they operate. German schools, for instance, close at midday. American schools shut down for two months in the summer. These things can be changed without huge cost. Some popular American charter schools now offer longer school days and shorter summer holidays. And, without going to Scandinavian lengths, America could invest more in its children: it spends a lower share of its GDP on public child-care than almost any other rich country, and is the only rich country that refuses to provide mothers with paid maternity leave. Barack Obama needs to measure up to his campaign rhetoric about \"real family values\".\n\nStill, these nagging problems should not overshadow the dramatic progress that women have made in recent decades. During the second world war, when America's menfolk were off at the front, the government had to summon up the image of Rosie the Riveter, with her flexed muscle and \"We Can Do It\" slogan, to encourage women into the workforce. Today women are marching into the workplace in ever larger numbers and taking a sledgehammer to the remaining glass ceilings.",

Calling her speech \"historic,\" Cox said Clinton's\ncommitment to a broad spectrum of human rights offers new hope in solving the desperation caused\nby poverty.\n\n\"By advancing the idea that human rights, development and participatory and accountable\ngovernance, are goals that mutually reinforce one another, Secretary Clinton has charted a course of\nleadership recognizing the indivisibility of human rights that has been missing in our government's\nmission abroad and at home,\" said Cox. \"Her statement today is an essential foundation for relieving\nthe suffering of billions in poverty, especially now when millions upon millions more people worldwide\nare experiencing economic hardship.\"\n\n\"We welcome Secretary Clinton's affirmation that the \"basics\" of well being -- food, shelter, health and\neducation --are not only human rights in and of themselves, but are also essential for the exercise of\nother human rights. Only by addressing both freedom from want and freedom from fear will it be\npossible to achieve genuine development for all.\"\n\nCox, who attended Secretary Clinton's speech on the administration's 21st century human rights\nagenda at Georgetown University, said he was especially grateful to hear Secretary Clinton outline\nher determination to make a real and long-term difference by tackling human rights and development\nas mutually reinforcing goals and affirm that the \"United States must lead by example in this area.\"\n\nCox also welcomed Secretary Clinton's commitment to stand with human rights defenders worldwide\nby shining a spotlight on their work and the legitimacy of their efforts. In her speech Secretary Clinton\nhighlighted the work of Women of Zimbabwe Arise, whose founders were recently honored at the\nWhite House, and noted the State Department had sent high-level diplomatic missions to meet with\nAung San Suu Kyi in Myanmar. It is important that the administration continue to champion human\nrights defenders around the world, especially those in powerful countries like China and Russia.\nCox also praised the Secretary for raising the question of accountability abroad and at\nhome. \"Secretary Clinton rightly identifies accountability as the centerpiece of any successful human\nrights agenda for the United States. But if the administration means what it says, then it needs to\nappoint a bipartisan commission to investigate the abuses connected to counterterrorism policies\nsince September 11, 2001, follow through on the executive orders it already has committed to, close\nthe prison at Guantanamo and abide by international legal commitments to end torture.\"\n\n\"The administration can't insist that other countries adhere to human rights protections while\ncontinuing to detain people outside the rule of law at home,\" Cox continued. \"Discussion of human\nrights can't be an empty rebranding exercise. The administration should promptly bring charges\nagainst the Guantanamo detainees who can be legitimately charged with a crime, and release the\nrest without further delay.\" To date, 116 individuals have already been cleared for release but remain\nunjustly detained in Guantanamo.\n\nNoting that in his Nobel Prize speech in Oslo, President Obama stated that \"no nation can insist that\nothers follow the rules of the road if we are not willing to follow those rules ourselves,\" Cox Stated,\n\"Amnesty International commends the administration for its commitment to engage closely on human\nrights. This is welcome change, but to make measurable progress we must prioritize accountability\nfor torture, implementation of human rights treaties, a strong Executive Order on Human Rights, and\nthe establishment of a national human rights commission.\"\n\nAmnesty International is a Nobel Peace Prize-winning grassroots activist organization with more than 2.2 million\nsupporters, activists and volunteers in more than 150 countries campaigning for human rights worldwide. The\norganization investigates and exposes abuses, educates and mobilizes the public, and works to protect people wherever\njustice, freedom, truth and dignity are denied.\nPlease visit www.amnestyusa.org for more information.",

    "text": "Politico\n\nPoll: Clinton approval soars\nBy: Eamon Javers\nDecember 16, 2009 03:00 PM EST\n\nA new poll of avid news watchers shows that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has a much higher\napproval rating than the man she once campaigned against and now works for, President Barack\nObama.\n\nIn the poll of 800 registered voters who are self-identified \"news watchers,\" Clinton had a 75 percent\napproval rating and a 21 percent disapproval rating overall. Obama, in contrast, had a 51 percent\napproval and a 45 percent disapproval rating.\n\nThe Secretary of State has conducted several well-received foreign trips in recent months and has\nnot been as closely identified with the more contentious elements of the Administration's agenda,\nincluding the health care fight, the federal deficit and the Wall Street bailouts. And she has not been\nsubjected to nearly the same media and partisan scrutiny as the president. Obama, meanwhile, has\nbeen on national television on a daily basis tackling a wide range of difficult issues.\n\nThe poll was conducted by the nonpartisan Clarus Research Group from December 7th to the 12th,\nand it asked for opinions of the top Cabinet secretaries and White House officials. Its finding on\nObama and Clinton mirrors that of earlier polls - in October, for example, a Gallup poll found that\nClinton had become more popular than the president.\n\nClarus president Ron Faucheux said one reason for Clinton's high poll numbers is her high approval\namong Republicans - numbers he said position her well to run for president again in the future, if she\nchooses. Clinton had 96 percent approval among Democrats, a healthy 57 percent approval among\nRepublicans, and 65 percent approval among Independents. Obama was nearly as popular among\nDemocrats - 93 percent - but his numbers among Republicans and Independents fell off\ndramatically, at 19 percent and 33 percent respectively.\n\nClinton's Republican numbers are striking, given how intensely disliked she has been in the past\namong GOP voters. In fact, part of Obama's appeal to Democratic primary voters in 2008 was that he\nwas more likely to be able to bridge the partisan divide than Clinton, who was by then a well-known\nfigure dating to her time as first lady in the 1990s.\n\n\"Republicans may see her as being more hawkish than other Democrats on foreign policy issues,\"\nsaid Faucheux. \"It may be a way for them to bolster that position within the administration.\" Asked\nabout any future Clinton presidential bid, he said, \"She's in good shape now.\"\n\nThe next highest-rated cabinet secretary in the survey was Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who\nnotched a 69 percent overall approval rate with a 78 percent approval among Democrats and 63\npercent among both Republicans and independents.\n\n\"Both Clinton and Gates did well across the partisan board,\" said Faucheux. \"Everybody else did well\namong Democrats but fell off among Republicans.\"\n\nAnother trend spotted by the pollsters: Approval ratings inside the Beltway were higher than in the\nrest of the country. \"These results show that the 'Beltway echo chamber' does not reflect the rest of\nthe country, even among news watchers,\" said Faucheux.\n\nAmong White House staffers and advisors, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs - who is often seen on\ntelevision - had the highest overall rating at 50 percent. Economic advisor Larry Summers had the\nlowest approval, at 25 percent.\n\nSummers and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner - who are both closely associated with the\neconomy - both posted higher disapproval numbers than approval. Summers' disapproval rating was\n41 percent. Geithner's disapproval rating was 45 percent, one point higher than his approval rating.\n\nThe poll also found that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, who is often viewed as having\nsharp partisan elbows, scored much higher among Democrats, at 72 percent, than Republicans, at 13\npercent.\n\nAmong other major administration officials, Vice President Joe Biden had a 50 percent approval and\n41 percent disapproval rating; Attorney General Eric Holder and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius\nboth posted 41 percent approval and 35 percent disapproval; Presidential Adviser David Axelrod\nscored 38 percent approval and 36 percent disapproval; and National Security Adviser James Jones\nhad a 30 percent approval and 23 percent disapproval rating.",

    "text": "FYI, there is a just released story on the front page of NYTimes.com that re-prints in full Amb. Eikenberry's November 2009 Cables (full story pasted below): http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/26/world/asia/26strategy.html?hp and http://documents.nytimes.com/eikenberry-s-memos-on-the-strategy-in-afghanistan?hp#p=1 January 26, 2010 U.S. Envoy's Cables Show Concerns on Afghan War Plans By ERIC SCHMITT WASHINGTON – The United States ambassador in Kabul warned his superiors here in November that President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan \"is not an adequate strategic partner\" and \"continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden,\" according to a classified cable that offers a much bleaker accounting of the risks of sending additional American troops to Afghanistan than was previously known. The broad outlines of two cables from the ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, became public within days after he sent them, and they were portrayed as having been the source of significant discussion in the White House, heightening tensions between diplomats and senior military officers, who supported an increase of 30,000 American troops. But the full cables, obtained by The New York Times, show for the first time just how strongly the current ambassador felt about the leadership of the Afghan government, the state of its military and the chances that a troop buildup would actually hurt the war effort by making the Karzai government too dependent on the United States. The cables one four pages, the other three - also represent a detailed rebuttal to the counterinsurgency strategy offered by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, the top American and NATO commander in Afghanistan, who had argued that a rapid infusion of fresh troops was essential to avoid failure in the country. They show that Mr. Eikenberry, a retired Army lieutenant general who once was the top American commander in Afghanistan, repeatedly cautioned that deploying sizable American reinforcements would result in \"astronomical costs\" --- tens of billions of dollars and would only deepen the dependence of the Afghan government on the United States. \"Sending additional forces will delay the day when Afghans will take over, and make it difficult, if not impossible, to bring our people home on a reasonable timetable,\" he wrote Nov. 6. \"An increased U.S. and foreign role in security and governance will increase Afghan dependence, at least in the short-term.\" Without offering details, Mr. Eikenberry has said in public hearings since then that his concerns have been dealt with, and that he supported the White House's troop increase plan. But it is not clear what might have changed about his assessment of President Karzai as a reliable partner, and the strong language of the cables may increase tensions between the ambassador and the Karzai government, especially as world leaders meet in London on Thursday to discuss a much-debated Afghan plan to reintegrate Taliban fighters. It also coincides with a strong effort by the administration to mend ties with Mr. Karzai. An American official provided a copy of the cables to The Times after a reporter requested them. The official said it was important for the historical record that Mr. Eikenberry's detailed assessments be made public, given that they were among the most important documents produced during the debate that led to the troop buildup. On Nov. 6, Mr. Eikenberry wrote: \"President Karzai is not an adequate strategic partner. The proposed counterinsurgency strategy assumes an Afghan political leadership that is both able to take responsibility and to exert sovereignty in the furtherance of our goal a secure, peaceful, minimally self-sufficient Afghanistan hardened against transnational terrorist groups. \"Yet Karzai continues to shun responsibility for any sovereign burden, whether defense, governance or development. He and much of his circle do not want the U.S. to leave and are only too happy to see us invest further,\" Mr. Eikenberry wrote. \"They assume we covet their territory for a never-ending 'war on terror' and for military bases to use against surrounding powers.\" He continued, \"Beyond Karzai himself, there is no political ruling class that provides an overarching national identity that transcends local affiliations and provides reliable partnership.\" In a second cable, dated Nov. 9, he expressed new concerns: \"In a PBS interview on November 7, Karzai sounded bizarrely cautionary notes about his willingness to address governance and corruption. This tracks with his record of inaction or grudging compliance in this area.\" On Monday, Mr. Eikenberry declined through an embassy spokeswoman, Caitlin M. Hayden, to comment on the cables and his views on Mr. Karzai. She said by e-mail, \"We stand by what we provided during the review process, which got us to the clear strategy we're now implementing, that the ambassador unequivocally supports.\" In his memos, Mr. Eikenberry raised other concerns. He said he had serious doubts about the ability of the Afghan police and military forces to take over security duties in the country by 2013. \"The Army's high attrition and low recruitment rates for Pashtuns in the south are crippling,\" he wrote. \"Simply keeping the force at current levels requires tens of thousands of new recruits every year to replace attrition losses and battlefield casualties.\" The ambassador, who left the military last April to become Mr. Obama's emissary, also complained about an inadequate civilian counterpart organization to the NATO military command in Afghanistan. Nearly three months later, he is still expressing concerns about too few civilian experts in Afghanistan. He also noted worries that the success of Mr. Obama's Afghanistan policy hinged on Pakistani forces' eliminating militants' havens in the mountainous region near the Afghan border. \"Pakistan will remain the single greatest source of Afghan instability so long as the border sanctuaries remain,\" he wrote. \"Until this sanctuary problem is fully addressed, the gains from sending additional forces may be fleeting.\" \"As we contemplate greatly expanding our presence in Afghanistan, the better answer to our difficulties could well be to further ratchet up our engagement in Pakistan,\" he wrote without elaboration. On Nov. 9, he repeatedly warned against rushing into a large deployment of more American forces without further study. He urged that the White House appoint a bipartisan panel of \"civilian and military experts to examine the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategy\" and provide recommendations by the end of 2009. The recommendation, which would have extended a White House-led policy review of many months, was not accepted. Mr. Eikenberry suggested sending a relatively small force to train Afghan security forces and protect some population centers, and to condition more troops on the Afghans' meeting objectives, like committing to taking full responsibility for national defense by a specific date. And while General McChrystal warned of failure if additional troops were not deployed, Mr. Eikenberry concluded by cautioning of competing risks \"that we will become more deeply engaged here with no way to extricate ourselves, short of allowing the country to descend again into lawlessness and chaos.\"",

    "text": "Attached and pasted below is material for the calls\n\nCalls to Brown and Northern Ireland Political Leaders\n\nPM Brown has asked to brief you on ongoing negotiations convened by the UK and Irish governments yesterday with FM Peter Robinson and dFM Martin McGuinness and their respective teams, which lasted until 3:30 a.m. in the morning and resumed at 9:00 a.m. today. Sinn Fein and the DUP are apparently not yet meeting face to face at Hillsborough but using the two governments as go betweens. On-site observers have characterized the current atmosphere between the two parties as \"poisonous.\"\n\nwere invited to Hillsborough yesterday night. However, these parties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included in any substantive meetings.\n\nOutstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue and setting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishing of the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restricting their desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying on local councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. Sinn Fein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades and PSNI involvement.\n\nIn late December, the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until December 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after the summer 2010 parading season.\n\nKey points:\n\nOutcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsing the current Executive, the Northern Ireland Act provides for seven calendar days for a new Executive to be formed. Failing that, the Assembly cease to operation and Secretary of State Woodward is supposed to schedule new elections though he is not required to do so within a certain timeframe. (Technically, it would take at least five weeks to organize new Assembly elections.)",

    "text": "Hi Huma - could you please show this to the Secretary? Senator Reid's staff and Senator Lautenberg would like the\nletter below sent to his office today. Upon receipt of the letter, we are told Senator Lautenberg will lift his hold on the\nGSP and ATPDA trade legislation. I know the Secretary would prefer to wait until there is a final decision in Brazil, but it\nis still unclear when that decision will come (may not even be today) and we have drafted the letter so that it still makes\nsense regardless of how and when the court rules. Thanks, and I'm at my desk if she wants to discuss it further. Rich\n\nDear Senator Lautenberg,\n\nI appreciated the opportunity to speak with you this past weekend regarding the custody case of Sean Goldman, the\nyoung American boy wrongfully detained in Brazil for more than five years. As we discussed, the Administration has\nlong maintained that Sean should be reunited with his father David in New Jersey. I have made a point of emphasizing\nthis position with Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim during our many conversations, as have other U.S. Officials\nwith their Brazilian counterparts.\n\nWe have worked closely with the Government of Brazil to ensure it upholds its obligations under the Hague Convention\non International Child Abduction. We were quite concerned by last week's decision suspending the order reuniting Sean\nwith his father. We were encouraged, however, by the appeal filed last Friday by the Brazilian Solicitor General which\nchallenges this suspension. Like you, we are eager to learn of the outcome of this appeal. We understand a decision\ncould be announced shortly.\n\nYou can be assured that we will continue advocating for the reunification of Sean and his father and pressing the\nGovernment of Brazil to ensure swift consideration of the Goldman case so that this long legal process may reach a final\nconclusion without further delay. In the meantime, please be assured that the State Department as well as the U.S.\nEmbassy in Brasilia has been and will continue to be a resource to the Goldman family during this trying time.\n\nSincerely,",

I can tell\nyou this morning the Secretary departed Washington and she stopped at the North Pole for an important bilateral\nmeeting with a well known international figure. During the meeting, in a formal demarche, sung to the tune of Twelve\nDays of Christmas, the Secretary outlined her aspirations for the new year. They include, and feel free to hum\nalong: open and accountable governments, Middle East negotiations, more civilians in Afghanistan, empowerment of\nwomen, fewer nuclear weapons, respect for human rights, resolution of historic grievances, treaties through the United\nStates Senate, Six-Party Talks, dialogue with Iran, enough food for people of the world to eat, climate change legislation,\nand lastly, a championship for the Boston Red Sox. Okay, that last one's not on her list, but Harold Koh and I thought it\nwas important that we mention that here.\"\n\nIt is a privilege to be a part of your team. We wish you, the President and Chelsea all the best during the holiday season\nand look forward to great achievements in 2010, with one tiny exception.\n\nPJ",

    "text": "Cheryl\n\nBrazil is 3 hours ahead of DC\nAnd the 1000 [our time] turnover has not yet taken place\n\nH/W report from our first-rate senior consular officer in Brazil and then some interesting backup [in two parts]\n\n1300 Local Time [1000 EST] Report\n\nI have just spoken with the Brazilian Central Authority regarding the orders imminently coming out of the office of the\nPresident of the 2nd Regional Federal Court. He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean\nthat the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the\nConsulate has started ticking again - not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the\ndeadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early\nhour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December\n24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order\nto permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.\n\nThere is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently\ntake the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.\n\nPress contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm\nlocal time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.\n\nWill pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.\n\nBACKGROUND\n• Brazilian Central Authority reports that at 1am local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted\nDaniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family\nis willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly\nreplied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal\n• machinations to delay implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do\nnot/not know what if any conditions the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police\nexecution of the court order continues.\n• Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the\ncase and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to\nhide Sean.\n• We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are\nsuccessful with wheels up.\n• We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to\nenforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio\nshould this extend past today.\n• We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys\nas to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should\npolice enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this\ntimeline shifts (as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)\n\nBackground Report from Tuesday evening / last nite\n\nPART I\n• Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant\nenforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police\nand judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take\ncustody of Sean.\n• Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to\nfacilitate departure.\n• David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at STJ will not be accepted\nby the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but\nhe seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this\nchanges.\n\nPART II\n• The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo\nhas received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing\nthe decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.\n• BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean\nGoldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until\nthe proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.\n• BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with\nDavid Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some\nunderstanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.\n\nWhat remains unclear:\n• We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home\ntonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that OOB here\ngenerally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring\nof Sean's whereabouts.\n• We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an \"immediate\" return order - it could mean right this\ninstant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at\nthe Consulate or some other site.\n• We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served\ngetting some rest now and starting first thing OOB which for us means 7-8am.\n• We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee\nreceiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.",

    "text": "Here's the update, pieced together from various sources:\n\nStarting at around 3 pm Friday, Adams and McGuinness returned to Hillsborogh to meet with Robinson and Arlene\nFoster. The four talked privately for several hours and then asked for the draft papers to review. The discussion\ncontinued until around 1 am when the parties left Hillsborough. (Foster's presence is apparently very helpful. Her\nrelationship with the SF leaders is much more positive and direct, treating them as equal colleagues.)\n\nWoodward and Irish FM Martin will meet with Adams and Robinson separately this afternoon to assess where the talks\nare. The talks last night/early morning ended more positively and if that is still the case there may be a decision to push\non today to see if agreement can be reached. It is equally possible that the two ministers and DUP/SF will decide to\nwind up today and resume on Monday.\n\nBrown and Cowen have spoken this morning and will speak again late this afternoon.\n\nThe issue is still parades. Robinson needs some certainity of change on parades. It is important for him politically within\nthe DUP, but also externally since this has become a symbol of whether he has achieved something or compromised too\nmuch. Adams and SF have moved very far from their original positions on parades, adding that Robinson has also\nmoved.\n\nThe DUP linkage of the timeframes for devolution and parades is not Robinson's goal but DUP deputy party leader Nigal\nDodds. Logistically, such a linkage would be impossible without delaying devolution given that the parades framework\nrequires consultation, legislation, and implementation.\n\nThe role of Justice Minister and his/her relationship to the Executive has been agreed. Other issues, such as Irish\nlanguage act, N-S bodies, etc, while symbolic and emotive for SF and the nationalists community can be dealt with.",

    "text": "I thought I would share this heartfelt message from Patricia Lamego de Teixeira Soares, the head of Brazil's Central Authority, the office responsible for Hague Convention abduction cases. You will see that in spite of our efforts to protect the son, the Brazilian family chose to make a spectacle outside the Consulate this morning by parading Sean through a crowd. Ms. Lamego recently visited the U.S. where she met with members of Congress and others to explain all that the Brazilian Central Authority was doing to reunite Sean and his father under the Hague Convention. The delays we saw in this case were largely the result of a wealthy, well connected family able to influence court decisions. We are all relieved and thrilled to see this long overdue but very happy ending. I should also highlight the amazing work done by US Mission Brazil. The consular staff, Charge, Acting DCM (Marie Damour, the Consul General in Brasilia), LegATT, RSO, and a host of others all played a role in this successful return. My OCS DAS, Michele Bond, and her dedicated team also played a big role in communicating with David, his lawyers, Congress, and the press. We had Members of Congress, former Assistant Secretaries and US Ambassadors all pitching in. While there were disagreements at times over tactics, we all agreed that we were working towards the same goal: the safe return of Sean. We particularly appreciate the strong support from the Secretary. Many people will try to take credit for today's happy reunion but it was the Secretary's continued concern and interest in this case that made the difference. We could not have provided a better gift to David Goldman during this season of giving. Janice",

    "text": "Dear All, The Goldman case finally came to an end, and despite the efforts of all involved the hand over of the child to the US Consulate in Rio was transformed into a deplorable display of the child walking in the streets with the maternal family, being exposed to the media and to the public that surrounded the consulate. I'm sorry this had to happen but it seems that Mr. Sergio Tostes, the maternal family's attorney, did not feel at all embarrased to use and expose the child, who was probably under severe stress, in order to gather support for his position. This most despicable man is not accepting the fact that, despite his life long relationships with influential authorities in Brazil, he was unable to win the case and Sean is finally being reunited with his only real father. I just hope that David and the Goldman family find enough time to recover their lives and their relationship with Sean. They need time more than anything else and now it is up to the US government to guarantee that David Goldman will not have to face the maternal family once again in the US courts where, according to Mr. Tostes last declaration to the Brazilian press, he will \"fight to defend the child\". Please allow David Goldman to live in peace with his son and have the life that he deserves after fighting so much for so many years. In my name and in the name of all the staff of the Brazilian Central Authority I wish David, Sean, and their family all the best and a most happy life once they are finally back in the United States. And to all of you who worked so much in support of this case, our deepest gratitude. We wish you all a Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year. Best regards, Patricia Lamego T.

The report was based on interviews conducted in May-June, before the new policy change was implemented, so much of the report is already OBE. OIG gave us the draft report in October, and SRAP/SCA/INL immediately sent a joint response to OIG (attached), highlighting that we were already working on many of the issues highlighted in the report. Given the change in policy and our letter to them, we found it pretty egregious that the OIG didn't report on the changes underway or adjustments already made, as the report is being portrayed in the press as currently applicable. Michael Keays on the Afghan desk and Peggy, who both help to oversee CN issues, are already working on a letter to OIG expressing our strong concern about the report and the process which got us to this point, and Vikram and his team are ginning up press points which also note that we have already begun to robustly address many of these points (I've cc'ed them all on this). If you'd like to talk further, I'm happy to come up to your office at some point this morning to discuss. Dan",

    "text": "Philippe and Jake asked me to send along this response to the Washington Post editorial:\n\nBy Michael Posner\n\nThe Post's Dec. 27 editorial (\"Redefining Human Rights\") on the Obama Administration's human rights and democracy\npolicies, and Secretary Clinton's recent speech at Georgetown in particular, misses the critical point: human rights,\ndemocracy, and development are mutually reinforcing, not competing goals. They complement each other in the task of\nmaking human rights a human reality.\n\nPresident Roosevelt understood the fundamental link between liberty, prosperity and security, tying together freedom\nof speech and worship with freedom from want and freedom from fear in his famous \"Four Freedoms\" speech. At\nGeorgetown, Secretary Clinton articulated a 21st century vision grounded in this wisdom.\n\nTo accuse Secretary Clinton of embracing a Soviet-bloc approach to human rights because she includes development in a\ndiscussion of democracy not only strains the bonds of credulity and common sense, it also walls off a crucial avenue for\nensuring that people can actually exercise the rights that are naturally theirs - including the rights to freedom of religion,\nassociation, and speech-in their daily lives.\n\nAs Secretary Clinton made clear, policies that address development alone are not adequate: \"Freedom doesn't come in\nhalf measures, and partial remedies will not solve the whole problem,\" she said. But experience shows us that where\nbroad-based development occurs, people are more likely to demand a say in securing their futures, and governments\nare more likely to have the resources to maintain the strong institutions, including reliable police and fair courts, that\nhelp ensure the consistent protection of rights. Where people are given the right to speak freely, to participate in their\nnation's political process and have access to basic information about government, sustainable development is more\nlikely to occur. At the same time, democracies without development do not last. These are mutually reinforcing tracks,\nand the Obama Administration is committed to pursuing both simultaneously.\n\nAs President Obama said in his Nobel lecture, \"engagement with repressive regimes lacks the satisfying purity of\nindignation.\" But the Post's overheated outrage ignores the lessons learned by generations of men and women who\nworked to advance human rights around the world.\n\nTo suggest that Secretary Clinton somehow provided excuses to rights-abusing dictators in a speech in which she\nforcefully criticized specific abuses across the world, is simply not credible. Far from being an excuse for any regime, this\nis an approach that pushes governments to do more to advance civil and political rights and to ensure that democracy\nactually delivers a measure of prosperity and opportunity for all. That is the right approach for the Obama\nAdministration and for the 21st century.\n\n##",

Sarah Palin, according to a Gallup poll out Wednesday. When Gallup asked 1,025 adults nationwide to name the woman they admire most, 16 percent picked Clinton. Palin was the only other woman to be mentioned by at least 10 percent, being selected by 15 percent of those surveyed. Daytime talk show host Oprah Winfrey came in third with 8 percent, edging out first lady Michelle Obama who got 7 percent. Rounding out the top 10 were former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Queen Elizabeth II, who both received 2 percent, along with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, poet Maya Angelou, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Elin Nordegren Woods, wife of golfer Tiger Woods - all of whom received 1 percent. Clinton has been named most admired woman by the poll 14 times, going back to her time as first lady. Only then-first lady Laura Bush in 2001 and Mother Teresa in 1995 and 1996 have been able to knock Clinton from her perch, though Palin came close. President Barack Obama ran away from the competition for most admired man, receiving the endorsement of 30 percent of those polled. Former President George W. Bush came in second with 4 percent, topping former South African President Nelson Mandela's 3 percent. Fox News host Glenn Beck, Pope Benedict XVI, the Rev. Billy Graham and Microsoft founder Bill Gates all received 2 percent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), former President George H.W.

    "text": "By Joseph Guyler Delva\nPORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - A Haitian judge said Thursday he had ruled in favor of the release of 10\nU.S. missionaries accused of kidnapping 33 children and trying to take them out of the earthquake-stricken\ncountry.\n\"I just signed the request for the release of the 10 Americans submitted by the lawyers and I have sent it to\nthe prosecutor's office,\" Judge Bernard Sainvil said.\nHe earlier told Reuters that once the prosecutor had given his opinion, he could formally issue a release order\nfor the Americans, who have been jailed since they were stopped at Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic\non Jan. 29.\nOnce the release order was issued, \"they can go directly to the airport if they want and leave, but they should\nprovide a guarantee of representation if further questions need to be asked,\" Sainvil said.\nUnder Haitian law, the prosecutor can formally comment on the judge's decision but he cannot overrule it.\nA judicial source told Reuters Wednesday that Sainvil had decided to free the U.S. missionaries because\nthere had been no evidence demonstrating \"criminal intentions\" on their part to support charges of child kidnap\nand criminal association leveled against them.\nThe missionaries, most of whom belong to an Idaho-based Baptist church, were arrested trying to take the\nchildren across the border to the Dominican Republic 17 days after a magnitude 7 earthquake that killed more\nthan 200,000 people in the impoverished Caribbean nation.\n\nPLEAS FOR RELEASE FROM PARENTS\nThe five men and five women have denied any intentional wrongdoing and said they were only trying to\nhelp orphans left destitute by the quake, which shattered the Haitian capital and left more than 1 million\nhomeless. But evidence showed that most of the children still had living parents.\nDuring hearings in the case, Sainvil heard from 10 parents of children handed over to the Americans. They\nsaid they had turned them over because they had no food or water to give them, and believed they would have a\nbetter life with the missionaries elsewhere.\nThese parents had pleaded for the Americans' release.\nThe case has been a distraction to the Haitian government as it tries to cope with the aftermath of the\nearthquake and was diplomatically sensitive for the United States as it heads a massive international effort to\nfeed and shelter Haitian quake survivors.\nThe U.S. government had said it was providing the Americans with consular access and monitoring their\ncase, but made clear it did not want to interfere.\nHaiti's beleaguered government had warned that traffickers could try to take advantage of the chaos that\nfollowed the quake by taking away vulnerable children, and it tightened adoption procedures.\n(Editing by Pascal Fletcher and Xavier Briand)\n\n\\\\10.40.0.17\\ReutersFeed\\XmlData\\2010-02-11T194557Z_01_N11147918_RTRIDST_0_QUAKE-HAITI-\nMISSIONARIES-UPDATE-2.XML",

His is an appropriately young face for an\nAmerican representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.\n\nAt a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an\nenduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. \"The challenge is to continue to communicate that\nthis is a long-term process,\" Hussain said. \"Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus\nexclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve.\"\n\nHussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,\nduring a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767843 Date: 08/31/2015\nThe family prayed regularly in a mosque not far from the church-heavy city. At about the time he began middle\nschool, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, \"it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain.\" But\nhe said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and\nbasketball\na passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his \"dream\" to play in one of Obama's\npickup games.\n\nHe graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to\npursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with\nRep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his\ndegree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,\n2001.\n\n\"I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin\ntowers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing whether there was a plane heading for the\nCapitol,\" he said. \"I very much experienced the terror on that day myself.\"\n\nIn the following days, he said, he experienced a \"whole set of feelings,\" from the initial fear of attack to worry\nabout discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of\npersecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.\n\n\"A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions\nthat Muslim communities have about the United States,\" he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim\nculture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said \"breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam.\" Isra\nBhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago\nBears fan.\n\nHussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a\nUniversity of South Florida professor, as \"politically motivated persecution.\" Arian was accused of aiding the\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the\ncharges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury\nacquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy.\n\n\"My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,\"\nHussain said. \"I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context.\"\n\nAfter the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow\nTar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media\nissues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.\n\nBen Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the\npresident's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American\nsociety and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays\ndaily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.\n\nHussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference\nat the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim\ncountries what \"America stands for,\" including through the partnerships.\n\n\"It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue,\" Hussain said. \"Our job will be to try to maximize\nour areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy.\"\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05767843 Date: 08/31/2015",

I expressed my sincerest condolences on behalf of the men and women of the State\nDepartment and the American people. This is one tragedy among so many. The United Nations has suffered grevious\nlosses. And the Hatian people have endured unimaginable heartbreak. For the State Department, we have lost one of\nour own. Victoria was a veteran Foreign Service Officer who worked tirelessly to build bridges of understanding and\nrespect between the people of the United State and the people of Haiti. She served her country with distinction and\nhonor, and she will be sorely missed. Victoria's friends and colleagues at the Embassy are working day and night to\nsupport vital relief and recovery efforts, and our thoughts, our prayers, and our deepest thanks are with them as well.\nAlong with the military personnel, the search and rescue teams, and all the aid and relief workers now deploying, they\nrepresent the unwavering commitment of the United States to stand with Haiti in its hour of need and in the hard days\nand years to come. My heart is with the DeLong family today, and with all those in Haiti and around the world who have\nlost loved ones and friends in this disaster.\n\n###",

    "text": "On democracy, Insulza repeated his line from 2005 (actually taken from Condi Rice) that it was not enough to be elected democratically; one had to govern democratically. He reviewed his own performance applying the Inter-American Democratic Charter (IADC) over the past five years and concluded that the record was good. He conceded that he had intervened too late in the Honduras case but said that was because Zelaya waited until too late to extend the invitation, asserting that he cannot intervene without an invitation from the executive branch. \"The truth is that we did everything possible to restore democracy in Honduras,\" he said. Insulza said the Honduras experience showed the OAS needs to develop \"swifter and more flexible procedures\" to allow it to respond more preemptively. This would include mechanisms for the OAS to \"make itself present in countries where there are possible signs of instability.\" Insulza committed to \"unreserved support\" for the OAS human rights mechanisms, while respecting their autonomy. \"Democracy is more than elections and includes such essential components as respect for human rights, freedom of expression, separation and independence of the branches of government, respect for the rule of law and the democratic institutional system, and transparency and honesty in government. It also establishes a link between democracy, development, and equity,\" he said. He talked about \"modern multilateralism,\" modeled on the EU, as his vision for the OAS. \"Modern multilateralism,\" he said, eschews Cold War divisions and \"we all work together to build on our common principles.\" On the management side, Insulza claimed he had inherited a bad financial situation at the OAS and improved it. Nonetheless, he said, \"we need more resources.\" He committed to seek them from non-traditional sources such as OAS observers, NGOs, the private sector and academia. He claimed his efforts to improve transparency and accountability had been commended by external auditors. Insulza committed to \"give fresh impetus to the gender issue at the OAS.\" Robert A.

I know this is a very difficult time for everyone\nat the Mission and our thoughts are with all of you.\n\nI had a good conversation with Jim Williams about the strategic communications initiative and I wanted to bring you up\nto speed on our thinking and where things stand with Keith.\n\nBased on our discussions and the excellent paper that Jim prepared I think there are several critical areas that we need\nto address:\n\n•\n•\n\nWork with our counterparts in the Mexican government to help them develop their capacity to handle the\ncommunications aspects of the drug initiative more effectively\nDevelop a process for ensuring the GOM and USG have clear, coordinated and consistent messaging on all\naspects of the initiative\nIncrease public awareness in Mexico about \"Merida\"; based on a report I got from INR last week there is very\nlittle awareness or understanding of the program in Mexico and the contributions of USG\nWork with GOM to develop an on-going and effective communications strategy at all levels to provide people\nacross the country with information that is directly relevant to them and which they need to navigate their way\nthrough this crisis. For example, what is going on in their community; what are local authorities doing; what\nprograms are available in their schools; what can they do, etc. I have increasingly come to believe that the lack\nof this sort of \"personally relevant\" information at a time of crisis increases public anxiety and contributes to the\noverall sense of things being out of control. We have begun to focus on this issue and have worked both in Haiti\nand last year in Pakistan to provide people with a steady stream of information they can use. We are using a\nwide array of communications tools to deliver these messages that allows the information to be delivered in a\nvery granular, local, personal way. The other benefit of this approach is that it helps balance the steady stream\nof gruesome news being put out by traditional media.\nWork with private sector in both Mexico and US to develop broad based PSA campaign to increase awareness of\nthe initiative and maintain public support for the effort\nIncrease awareness in Mexico of USG efforts to combat drug use in US\n\nKeith has reached out to a number of his associates at BDA and unfortunately he has met with some resistance to BDA\ntaking this project on. The personal safety issue seems to be the biggest concern. I do believe we will be able to\novercome this to some degree and I have some ideas which we can discuss when we next speak. In the meantime I have\nreached out to Pat Mitchell of the Paley Center and she believes she will be able to help engage the US private sector\nonce we have a plan of action in place.\n\nFinally, with regard to next week's trip by S, Jim feels it might be better for me to come to Mexico sometime in late April\nrather than have it as part of next week's agenda. I am happy to do whatever works best for you. Keith is also prepared\nto come next week or in April. Just let us know.\n\nJudth",

    "text": "Cuba leaders 'do not want' normal ties with US: Clinton\nWASHINGTON, April 10, 2010 (AFP) - Cuba's leadership does not want to normalize ties with Washington because they\nwould \"lose their excuses\" for the country's economic stagnation, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday.\nThe United States maintains a decades-old trade embargo on the Americas' only one-party Communist regime, but\nPresident Barack Obama took office last year offering to improve ties if President Raul Castro improved human rights.\nClinton however blamed Castro and his brother Fidel -- Cuba's leader from 1959 to 2008 -- for undermining\nWashington's bid to improve relations.\nDespite US efforts to \"enhance cooperation,\" Clinton said that the Castro brothers \"do not want to see an end to the\nembargo and do not want to see normalization with the United States because they would then lose all their excuses for\nwhat hasn't happened in Cuba in the last 50 years,\" Clinton said.\n\"I find that very sad, because there should be an opportunity for a transition\" to democracy in Cuba,\" said Clinton, who\nwas answering a student's question during a visit to the University of Louisville in the state of Kentucky.\n\"The people of Cuba should have democratically elected leaders and a chance to chart their own future. But\nunfortunately, I don't see that happening while the Castros are still in charge,\" the top US diplomat said.\nRaul Castro officially became president in 2008 after his older brother was sidelined with serious health problems.\nHowever Fidel, now 83, remains enormously influential in Cuban affairs.\nClinton also noted what she said was a growing acknowledgment from the international community that Havana was\ncracking down on human rights.\n\"For the first time, a lot of countries that had done nothing but berate the United States for our failure to be more open\nto Cuba have now started criticizing Cuba because they let people die,\" she said.\n\"Many in the world are now seeing what we have seen for a long time, which is a very intransigent, entrenched regime\nthat has stifled the opportunity for the Cuban people.\"\nA leading political prisoner, Orlando Zapata, died in hospital February 23 after 85 days into a hunger strike protesting\nCuban prison conditions.\nTwo other Cuban dissidents -- cyber journalist Guillermo Farinas and doctor Darsi Ferrer are currently engaged in\nhunger strikes demanding improved conditions.\nAccording to the Cuban Commission on Human Rights (CCDHRN), an illegal but tolerated group on the island, there are\nsome 200 political prisoners in Cuba.\nRaul Castro on April 4 vowed never to give in to the dissidents' demands, calling it \"blackmail\" organized by the United\nStates and Europe.\nThe Cuban president charged the United States and Europe with waging \"an unprecedented publicity war\" against\nHavana allegedly supported by \"major Western media.\"\nMedia Analysis and Watch Center\nUSSTRATCOM Foreign Media Analysis Program SOS International Ltd.\nwww.sosiltd.com\nFor additional information, please visit the SOSI USSTRATCOM FMA portal at\nhttp://fma.sosiltd.com/secure/?SID=SECF83EFBEF.

Lost alongside President Kaczynski and his wife were Polish leaders from\nacross the political spectrum, men and women who shaped and sped Poland's post-1989 democratic transformation and\nwere leading Poland into its promising future. The tragedy of these lives cut short will be felt deeply across the world,\nbut their legacy will live on in a free and flourishing Poland.\n\nThe United States stands with the Polish people in this difficult hour. Like the country he led, President Kaczynski was\none of America's most valued and trusted allies. He was well known in the United States as a champion for democracy\nagainst an oppressive regime, a man whose journey took him from the Gdańsk Shipyards to the presidency of a free\npeople. President Kaczynski was an unstinting advocate for freedom and human rights not just in Poland, but around\nthe world. He will be long remembered and sorely missed.\n\nThe Polish people have endured more than their share of sorrow, but they have always shown resilience and resolve in\nthe face of adversity -- and I know they will pull together in solidarity to grieve this loss.\n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with all the people of Poland today.",

Dick\nLugar said today after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with President Barack Obama hosting\nHaitian President René Préval. Earlier in the day, former President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign\nRelations Committee that this should be a priority.\n\n\"As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti, a top priority for\nrecovery and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant assistance to get Haitian\nchildren quickly back into the classroom,\" Lugar said. \"Assistance for infrastructure, technical assistance for\ninstruction and curriculum development especially should be included. Only with a strong education initiative\nwill Haiti have a chance at a better future.\"\n\nLugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday, March 5.\nDuring the visit, staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and reported to Lugar that\nthousands of schools in and around Port au Prince could remain closed for months or never reopen. As a result,\nHaitian children could be left languishing in refugee camps. Before the January 12 earthquake approximately\none-half of Haiti's school-age children were enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's\npopulation.\n\n\"The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual, cooperative\narrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the resources and expertise of\nthe United States Government and international community are brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti.\nEducation of the Haiti's youth is an appropriate starting point,\" Lugar said.\n\n###",

Gul was briefly ISI chief during PM Bhutto's first term in office almost 20\nyears ago. Appearing on several TV stations this week, Gul has repeated allegations that the U.S. is implicated in the\nBhutto Assassination - the subject is current this week because of the release of the U.N. report on the assassination,\nwhich is itself a remarkable document.\n\nOne ironic element of the UN report on the assassination is the report that on October 16, 2007 former PM Bhutto\nwrote to General Musharraf that the very same Hamid Gul was one of three people she considered a threat to her\nsecurity. (see excerpt below) This fact came up in none of the programs.\n\nOur view is that the television journalists and executives now must begin taking responsibility for putting inciting and\nunsubstantiated claims on the air. We have released the attached \"Correction,\" which will be seen by news editors\nacross the country.\n\nLarry\n\nExcerpt from the UN report on the Bhutto assassination:\n\n179. On 16 October 2007, Ms Bhutto writing from Dubai to General Musharraf, identified three people she considered a\nthreat to her security: (i) Brigadier (ret) Ejaz Shah, Director General of the IB at the time of the assassination, (ii) General\n(ret) Hamid Gul, a former Director General of the ISI, and (iii) Mr Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, Chief Minister of Punjab until\n22 November 2007.",

A few vignettes.\n\n- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles). Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.\n\n- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion. Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.\n\n- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's when you and President come on the screen.\n\n- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and the bison stuffed animals - who knew?\n\nAnyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.\n\nSmart power works!",

    "text": "April 27, 2010\n\nFor: Hillary\nFrom: Sid\nRe: Greek economic crisis; transatlantic consequences\nCC: Cheryl\n\nA potential second major phase of the economic crisis, at least in Europe, likely with repercussions in the US, is\nbeing triggered with the designation of Greece to junk band status, on the edge of default, with Portugal, Spain,\nand perhaps even Ireland at tipping points. This is more than a further unfolding of the economic crisis,\nthreatening recovery; fissures within the transatlantic relationship will now be under intensifying strain. More\nthan statements from Treasury should be forthcoming in the days ahead. This is about the future of the\ntransatlantic relationship. Reassuring words about our enduring commitment will matter.\n\nI've been having conversations with John Kornblum and those discussions prompted this email from him a\ncouple of days ago, before the latest Greek event:\n\n-- the economic crisis is starting to have a negative effect on dynamics among EU\nmembers. Tensions over deficits, Greece etc are uncovering major gaps among the major players.\n\n-- Germany has emerged stronger than others. German voters believe (correctly) that they have\nsacrificed to maintain stability and are increasingly angry over signs of obvious mismanagement by\nGreece and others. The strains of Afghanistan are being felt by everyone and while the President is\nvery popular in Europe, EU leaders miss the regular stroking by the US which for decades has been\nan essential aspect of their self-confidence.\n\n-- Germany's harsh reaction to Greece has shaken everyone, perhaps the French most of all. They\nnow see that Germany has been remaking the EU behind the scenes without their noticing\nit. Commonality on major issues is declining.\n-- Continuation of this trend would be very damaging to US interests. Global markets could be\nweakened significantly if the budgetary crises continue. Cooperation on issues such as Afghanistan\nand Iran could be undermined. In the worst case, the President could be confronted with a major\ncrisis of confidence among members of the EU. He would be blamed for inattention to the negative\ntrends.\n\n-- Things are not in crisis, but the trends are worrying enough to warrant a senior effort to focus the\ndialogue, especially with the Germans and the French. Assuming the Conservatives win in the UK,\nthere will be a need to guide them successfully into office. Others such as the Poles and the Turks\ncannot be ignored.\n\n-- In other words, we cannot treat our partnership with Europe as just another point on a multipolar\nmap. Maintaining consensus within Europe and between the US and Europe is essential to\nmaintaining a foundation for our global efforts.",

    "text": "Greetings from Nairobi. I'm at the end of week-long trip to Kampala, Kinshasa and now Nairobi. The trip has been very productive and I will fill you in on some of the discussions I have been having when I return. In the meantime, I know that there are a number of discussions with Dan Benjamin and others relating to a new more aggressive approach to CVE and I wanted to update you on my thoughts in terms of how those critical discussions fit in with our overall approach to strategic communications around the globe.\n\nAs you and I have discussed, it is essential that we become much more pro-active in all our communications efforts. To put it bluntly, we are in an \"information war\" on all fronts. With the proliferation of media outlets and opportunities around the world, we must fight aggressively to get, and maintain, our fair share of \"consumer share of mind.\" Both our adversaries and allies recognize the importance of this aspect of foreign policy and are adopting new ways of communicating with foreign publics. Consumers everywhere are constantly facing a barrage of information and in some cases misinformation and dis-information. In order to get our messages across and confront the threats posed by our adversaries, we must develop a new sense of urgency in all our communications efforts. Much has been said and written about the concept of \"soldier diplomats\". In the same vein, I believe we must empower a corps of \"diplomat soldiers\" to help us gain ground in this new war.\n\nWhile countering violent extremism is, and will remain, a key objective of our communications efforts we must apply the same level of determination with respect to all communications. We must both aggressively promote positive stories about the US and rapidly respond to attacks against us. In the past, our failure to respond to attacks and distortions has diminished our credibility and undermined our ability to combat our adversaries. For example, had we not responded to all the rumors and innuendos surrounding our relief efforts in Haiti, I believe we would have provided a fertile field for AQ and others to continue to perpetuate the image of the US as an \"invader\".\n\nBefore I left for this trip, I convened a meeting of our top PD officers and told them that we must become much more aggressive in our strategic communications programs and initiatives. We plan to implement daily calls between our new regional PD DAS's and PAO's in the regions so we can monitor on a daily basis all stories about the USG. We will work with the Posts to ensure that they have strategies for dealing with stories as they develop. I would also like to request that you send a cable to all Chiefs of Mission informing of the new strategy and reminding them of their responsibilities in this critical area. We will work on a draft for your review when you return.\n\nFinally, we are developing new organizational solutions, modeled on an approach I saw at our Mission in Uganda, which I think will greatly clarify roles and responsibilities with respect to in country communications not only within the Mission, but across all government agencies within particular countries.\n\nI will continue to update you as we move forward.\n\nHope your trip is going well. Look forward to greeting together when we are both back in DC.\n\nJM",

    "text": "This is an AFP report from today.\n\nAlso, GTIP is working on a memo for you and Cheryl about child trafficking dangers in Haiti.\n\nTrafficking fears as Haiti children go missing\n\nPosted 5 hours 47 minutes ago\nUpdated 5 hours 46 minutes ago\n\n* Slideshow: Photo 1 of 2\n\nThe UN has warned countries not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the wake of the disaster. (AFP: Matthew Marek\n\nUnited Nations officials say children have gone missing from hospitals in Haiti since the devastating January 12 earthquake, raising fears of trafficking for adoption abroad.\n\n\"We have documented around 15 cases of children disappearing from hospitals and not with their own family at the time,\" said UNICEF adviser Jean Luc Legrand.\n\n\"UNICEF has been working in Haiti for many years and we knew the problem with the trade of children in Haiti that existed already beforehand.\n\n\"Unfortunately, many of these trade networks have links with the international adoption market.\"\n\nThe agency said it had warned countries during the past week not to step up adoptions from Haiti in the immediate wake of the quake.\n\nHowever several are fast-tracking adoption procedures already under way, including Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.\n\nMr Legrand said the situation was similar to the aftermath of the tsunami in Asia five years ago.\n\nTrafficking networks were springing into action immediately after the disaster and taking advantage of the weakness of local authorities and relief coordination \"to kidnap children and get them out of the country\".\n\nRupert Colville, a spokesman for the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said child enslavement and trafficking in Haiti was \"an existing problem and could easily emerge as a serious issue over the coming weeks and months\".\n\nThe UN mission in Haiti has stepped up surveillance of roads, UNICEF officials said.\n\nMr Legrand said there was separate but only anecdotal evidence of people taking children by road to the neighbouring Dominican Republic and loading children on to planes.\n\n\"We have seen over the past years many children being taken out of the country without any legal procedure,\" he said.\n\n\"This is going on. This is happening now. We are starting to have the first evidence of that, this is unquestionable.\"\n\nHe was unable to give details on the 15 missing children or their condition or clearly connect the anecdotal observations in Haiti's chaos with trafficking.\n\nThe cases were documented by social workers and by partner non-governmental organisations working for UNICEF in hospitals.\n\n- AFP",

I am assured by the Superintendent, General JHB Peay, and the department\nhead of International Relations/Political Science, Colonel Jim Hentz that the award is hers if she will accept it. This is a\n\"done deal.\"\n\nAll that is needed for her to receive an official letter from General Peay is for me to know that she will accept the\naward. They want to\ngive her the award this year on a suitable day before graduation in late May. The letter will ask her to address the corps\nof cadets in a suitable on post (campus) setting. I would like to see it in Jackson Memorial Hall, a beautiful medieval\nrevival building. An alternative setting would be the two story atrium in the Marshall Center for Leadership and\nEthics. The award would be presented at the end of the address. Media coverage would be welcomed and\nassisted. She would be honored by being the reviewing person at a regimental review of the corps. A suitable dinner\nand or luncheon would be arranged.\n\nIf this is going to happen it would be a good idea to set the wheels in motion as soon as possible so that the staffs can\nwork out the details.\n\nBest\n\nPat Lang\nVMI '62",

Forsell took a series of photos at Har\nHoma, a massive Israeli settlement towering over the Palestinian town of Beit Sarhour. Her photos show ongoing\nconstruction of hundreds of new settlement units - documents of the settlement freeze sham.\nNetanyahu authorized the building of new settlement units just days after he\nannounced the freeze in November 2009. He attempted to disguise new settlement construction by drawing a false\ndistinction between the West Bank and \"parts of Jerusalem\" like Har Homa that actually lie outside 1967 lines. As Israeli\ngovernment flack Mark Regev remarked in December 2009, \"We've made a clear distinction between the West Bank and\nJerusalem. Jerusalem is our capital and will stay as such.\" With a few exceptions, Obama allowed this scheme to go\nforward.\nAccording to the Washington Post, Obama's meeting with Netanyahu this week will have more to do with reassuring\nJewish Democrats than with halting the wholesale colonization of the West Bank. As the Post's Anne Kornblut reported,\n\"The White House meeting will not dwell on some of the most difficult time-sensitive issues, including the expiration of a\nmoratorium on Israeli settlement construction in September.\" This may mean an end to the settlement freeze, but it was\nonly an illusion after all.",

The severed head of a volunteer for Integrity Uganda, the pro-LGBT\norganization founded by Bishop Christopher Senyonjo, was found in a pit latrine on a farm in Makindye\nSabagabo, Wakiso District.\n\nJudith Nabakooba, a police spokesperson, identified the head as that of Pasikali Kashusbe, one of\nthe workers on Kigggundu's farm and a member of Integrity Uganda. Pasikali and his partner\nAbbey are youth workers with Integrity Uganda charged with the responsibility of mobilising\nyoung LGBT people in activities which build community capacity to face up to the challenge of\nhomophobia, especially in the area of attitude change and care through drama and sports\nactivities.\nAccording to the police, a mutilated torso which was earlier in the week discovered in Kabuuma\nZone, about half a kilometre away from Kiggundu's farm was probably Pasikali's The torso was\ndescribed as belonging to a young man and had no genitals.\nPasikali went missing over three and half weeks ago when the country was celebrating Uganda\nMartyrs Day. All efforts by his partner Abbey and other family members to find him had been\nfruitless.\nBishop Christopher Senyonjo, Chairperson of Integrity Uganda lamented the murder of this\nyoung man as 'absurd' adding that, 'clearly, the values of tolerance and social inclusion are sadly\nbeing sacrificed on the altar of state ignorance, ineptness and good old colonial stupidity'.\nUganda's Martyr's Day, a national holiday, is a particularly dangerous time for LGBT people. The holiday\ncommemorates the death of several Anglican and Catholic missionaries ordered by the Bugandan King Mwanga\nII, who felt that foreign religious influences posed a threat to his kingdom. In fact, his fears proved correct; the\nexecutions prompted Britain to invade Uganda and turn it into a British colony. Popular lore has it that King\nMwanga II, who himself was a teenager, killed the martyrs because they refused his homosexual advances. It is\nunclear how much of that part of the story is true or how much of it is lore that was reinforced by the British\ncolonial government to discredit the king.\nThe farm where Kashusbe's head was found is reportedly owned by Badru Kiggundu, who is the chairman of\nUganda's Electoral Commission. Police found the head while searching for a missing priest, Rev Henry Kayizzi\nNsubuga, who disappeared almost two and half weeks ago after delivering a speech at St. Paul's Church in\nKanyanya supporting homosexuality in Uganda.\nThe independent television network NTV Uganda posted this video three days ago, but doesn't mention the\ncircumstances which appear to have led to Pasikali's murder:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBjlbN3gtnQ\nDaily Monitor, Uganda's largest newspapers, has a few more sparse details here. In this report, the victim is\nidentified as Paschal Kashushu. Amid conflicting reports, it appears that at at least one man has been arrested,\npossibly a relative. I'm trying to get more information directly from Uganda.\nChanging Attitudes has this statement from Rev Erich Kasirye, General Secretary, Integrity Uganda:\nPasikali and his partner Abbey joined Integrity Uganda in June 2007 and during the last three\nyears, Integrity Uganda has seen an increase in coordination and harmonisation of youth\nactivities. Pasikali emphasized the promotion of the concept of care across the continuum\nthrough the formation of voluntary home care groups for young LGBTIs who continue to live in\nfear. He will be greatly missed by the entire LGBTI fraternity.\nAs for the missing priest, the only direct news reports that I can find about him appear in the government-owned\nNew Vision. There is no mention of Rev. Nsubuga's sermon. Instead, it appears that relatives are painting the\nmissing priest as mentally “stressed.\" A report by a reporter from Kamulali Newspaper and re-published on the\nvirulently anti-gay web site Virtue Online provides more hints about the possible link between Rev.

Below is some brief information on the proposal, which was made by Saudi Arabia:The proposal made by the then crown prince (now king) in Feb. 2005 called for the establishment of an international counterterrorism center \"under the auspices of the UN.\" The purpose of the organization would be to, among other things, \"develop a mechanism for exchanging information and expertise between States\" on a wide range of non-military counterterrorism issues, encourage the establishment of national and regional centers, and provide assistance to developing countries to deal with crises and terrorist acts. The center, as conceived in 2005, would also allow national counterterrorism coordinators from different countries and regions to meet and share information and experiences.This proposal was endorsed by the OIC (and OIC countries reaffirm their support for the center each year at the UNGA), but has never received any serious consideration within the UN by non-OIC members. The Saudis continue to be interested in implementing the proposal. Most significantly, recently there have been discussions between the UN and Saudis as to how their proposal could be married with efforts to enhance the UN's capacity to support implementation of the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy by allowing the UN Counter-Terrorism Task Force (CTITF) Office and the different CTITF member entities to engage more actively and directly with CT experts/practitioners in capitals and have multilateral CT consultations wherever necessary.But S/CT mentioned that, if we were to move forward on S/CT's CTO idea, we would hope to work closely with the Saudis.Please let me know if you would like any further info.Thanks,Mike",

    "text": "Our clips service doesn't have the license necessary to provide FT (or Reuters) content, so here's the long awaited FT profile - you'll be especially interested in the guest column David Milliband wrote: An FT interview with Hillary Clinton By Daniel Dombey FT June 11 2010 22:21 This is what it is like to be Hillary Clinton. The motorcade, twisting and skidding through rain-splashed streets for more than an hour; the public meetings and camera lights at journey's end; the spotlight that has not let up for two decades. It is almost as if the 2008 US presidential election - hailed as the most exciting for a generation - had never ended. But this is a campaign without a vote. Today, Clinton's convoy is snaking through São Paulo, Brazil, not South Hampton, New Hampshire. She herself is no longer an aspirant for the White House, despite what the overnight flights, town hall meetings and strategy sessions that make up her gruelling schedule might suggest. Instead, she is in Latin America to shore up relations with the region and promote a new idea of US leadership, one very much built around herself. She's had bigger and more ecstatic audiences than the 700-odd students and staff crammed into the hall tonight at Zumbi dos Pradares, an Afro-Brazilian university, but she's still greeted by a wave of raised arms as the audience snaps away at her with their mobile phones. In the convoy moments before, she was wrapped in a shawl, suffering from a cold and angry at the delays that pushed us into the side streets speckled with box-like bars, warehouses and love hotels while Brazilian motorists sought to cut into our path. There is no sign of that now. With the metabolism of a born politician, she feeds off the energy of her audience and takes questions from students, teachers and local celebrities for an hour. Hillary Clinton never looks happier than when she is centre stage. Most US secretaries of state wouldn't bother with this sort of event, much less initiate it and arrange for it to be screened on the biggest local channel. Yet this is what Clinton does on almost every foreign trip and she seems to spend half her life on her official 727, crammed with long-time aides and armed bodyguards. The schedule is backbreaking and constantly shifting. She has notched up more than a quarter of a million miles since taking office. On this Latin America trip, thrown into confusion by an earthquake in Chile, we have already visited four countries in 24 hours. We go to tiny Uruguay, where our stay is so brief we check into a hotel just for a shower; Argentina, where we spend almost all our time at the presidential palace; Chile itself, where we don't leave the airport; and Brazil, where we spend almost a full day. So what exactly is Clinton trying to do on this never-ending world tour? Travelling with her for a week, talking to people inside and outside the administration, I tried to find out. \"We now have a case to make and it is not just a case that is made to the president or the prime minister or the foreign minister or an ambassador,\" she tells me a few weeks later, as she perches on a sofa in her expansive office, with its view of the Lincoln Memorial. \"People now have a voice and an opinion and a vote in many instances on the direction that their own societies take ... I want to model a different kind of leadership that is open and willing to listen but [also] to stand our ground if necessary.\" She argues that these trips of hers help to restore the US's image in the wake of the Bush administration by making contact with public opinion abroad, and so boosting American power. Her aides say that, as a battle-hardened politician who also happens to be one of the most famous women in the world, she is ideally placed to carry out the task. But the deeper question is whether she is merely implementing the foreign policy crafted by Barack Obama, her boss and former rival, or whether her role and ambitions go beyond that. Is she a kind of saleswoman-in-chief for the US, I ask? \"Well, I think that is part of the job,\" she replies, toying with the napkin underneath her glass of water. \"If you are making a case for American values and for American leadership, you have to make it where people now get information ... Given the bridges we had to build and some of the repair work we had to do, we had to travel.\" As in São Paulo, her system is under strain - \"I've been fighting this all day,\" she says as she masks a cough set off by her allergies (Washington's cherry blossom trees are shedding their flowers). Life is still hectic - the volcanic ash cloud has just all but paralysed Europe and televisions throughout the State Department are showing the first British election debate. But Clinton remains enthusiastic, affable and unhurried, her speech peppered with exclamations such as \"oh my gosh\", even as she discusses issues of state. She politely asks if I have any updates for her about Europe's airspace shutdown and tells me she's been talking to Norway's foreign minister about it. \"He said that this dust gets into engines of any size, even Air Force One - it's chunky! I don't know how else to describe it,\" she says, an odd note of hilarity entering her voice as she pronounces the word \"chunky\". Clinton often speaks in this eager, unvarnished way a world away from the clipped, on-message manner of her immediate predecessor in the post, Condoleezza Rice. If anything, she is an undiplomat - known less for calibrated circumlocutions than for her plain speaking and sometimes her gaffes, a woman who retains both a formidable political constituency and a laugh she once admitted can send cats scurrying from a room. Her staff point out she is only the third elected politician in 60 years to have served as secretary of state, and the first to come from outside the foreign policy establishment since James Baker, George H.W. Bush's right-hand man and perhaps her most illustrious recent predecessor. She may be the most substantive politician in the office since William Jennings Bryan, the three-time presidential candidate who served as secretary almost a century ago. \"Her stature on the world stage, her almost presidential stature, has set her apart,\" Bill Burns, the top career diplomat at the State Department, tells me. \"Leaders want to meet her. And the town hall meetings do make a difference with public opinion.\" The great collaborator Clinton has established strong working relationships within the Obama administration When I ask Clinton later about how she managed to move from the antagonism of the primary race to the obedience of office, she dismisses my question with an anodyne \"that's politics\". She adds: \"We're working really hard and well together It just never comes up any more, it seems like ancient history to me.\" Not so ancient, I think, that she is willing to admit the failings of her campaign. \"I always run inclusive and successful organisations,\" she retorts when I ask her whether she'd applied any lessons from that searing experience to her new post. She admits she didn't want the job at State - she says she was exhausted by the election and missed the Senate - \"but at the end of the day, I'm pretty old-fashioned and if the president asks you to do something, you'd better have a really good reason why you can't.\" Also, she adds: \"Suppose I had won and I were asking him to be in my cabinet ... I would have wanted him to say yes.\" Others say the relationship is more complex, that by dint of her loyalty and unflagging hard work, Clinton has moved closer to the charmed circle and made herself an even more formidable political force than before. \"Quite simply, she gives good advice and the president over a year and a half has recognised that,\" says Anne-Marie Slaughter, head of the State Department policy planning unit. \"The relationship is based on her performance in the job.\" By all accounts, it's a collaborative partnership, though not perhaps a warm one. Clinton boasts a good working relationship with the main players of the administration - and has formed something of an alliance with defence secretary Robert Gates, although on life-and-death issues such as Afghanistan, it is Gates, not her, who has taken the lead. As one official told me, secretaries of state have often either been popular with their own department - Colin Powell comes to mind or with the rest of the administration as was Condoleezza Rice - but Clinton has managed to be both. In truth, Clinton's language remains harder-edged than Obama's - she recently claimed that Iran's Revolutionary Guard had staged a slow-motion coup and she has sometimes been more willing than he is to hint at using the military. \"She seems to step up with a bit of spine just at the right time,\" says Kurt Volker, a US ambassador to Nato under George W. Bush. She has also assumed an ever more prominent role in talking to leaders such as Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan apparently because she is trusted both by them and Obama. Meanwhile, she has been careful to keep her husband, the former US president, in the background. Aides say they have barely seen him in the building - though Clinton herself says that behind the scenes Bill Clinton gives her strategic advice. \"One of his favourite sayings, that I remind myself of all the time, is a kind of baseball saying,\" she says: \"Don't major in the minors; keep your eye on not just the headlines but the trend lines.\" It is her co-operative stance rather than any notable effort to set out a grand vision of her own that is the chief theme of her time so far at State. When I ask Clinton to name her proudest achievement in office, she replies \"the effective and collaborative approach that this administration has taken towards identifying and solving problems.\" A more process-oriented, less provocative answer would be hard to imagine. But maybe, I think, the US has less scope for grand strategy than it did in the past couple of decades, when the country seemed to bestride the world colossus-style. Clinton herself suggests that so formidable are the tasks confronting the US that the administration has little scope to enter into internecine fights but needs instead to focus on the challenges to hand. Whatever the reason for her stance, it seems to be a smart decision by all accounts she's overcome many of the suspicions the White House retinue had towards her. \"It's fair to say that she was not born into the administration's inner circle but slowly but surely, for the most consequential decisions, she now has a prime seat at the table,\" says one official. Praising what he calls her \"Terminator-quality durability and determination,\" he adds: \"She's done an amazing amount of work, judging that the way to build a strategic vision is bottom up, by mastering the details.\" Indeed, Clinton's ability to master the most arcane foreign policy briefs is the marvel of her building. She has dropped into obscure working groups and shown an unnerving knowledge of their details. At her confirmation hearings last year she exchanged facts about the arctic with an Alaskan senator; at the meeting in São Paulo she becomes enthused about freight transport policy both in Brazil and the US. She herself acknowledges that finding her feet on foreign policy was something of a struggle, despite her campaign claims of expertise in the field. \"It was so intellectually challenging, just to get our arms around all of these issues,\" she says. During her first year, she was criticised for apparent gaffes - including the way she called for Israel to halt all building of settlements on occupied territory only to hail a partial freeze a few months later as unprecedented. On an election campaign, she says, \"you may be in a different city four times a day but you have a message you're trying to deliver that is repetitive and aimed at your audience. But here you might deal with 10 different countries' problems, six different regional or global challenges in the course of a day.\" As the Latin America tour shows, she is now trying to do both - travel incessantly and solve an array of international issues. She is at the forefront of the US's efforts to consolidate relations with a number of important countries - predominantly Russia and China, but also rising powers such as Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia and South Africa and to cool down anti-American feeling in hotspots, notably Pakistan. She says the push is working, hailing a \"change in public opinion in places that were pretty negative about the US\" a reference to Russia and Pakistan. But it is far from smooth sailing. Differences about Iran and over Israel's raid on aid-bearing ships off Gaza have stoked tensions with Turkey and Brazil recently, amid questioning of the effectiveness of the Obama administration's policies. During my time with her on the road, the stop in Brazil is the focal point - not surprising given the country's increased profile as Latin America leader. Clinton is now heading the administration's push to secure sanctions on Iran, and in Brasilia she tries and fails to win President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to her cause. She employs an almost combative tone at a press conference with Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister. At moments she appears to barely contain her irritation, as she denounces \"an Iran that runs to Brazil\" as well as other countries such as Turkey and China \"telling different things to different people to avoid international sanctions\". Amorim is spiky in his own way - drawing parallels to the 1990s sanctions on Iraq and the claims about weapons of mass destruction before the 2003 war. \"Of course, I don't agree with everything the Secretary said,\" he says. It is not a happy experience indeed this past week both Brazil and Turkey voted against sanctions at the United Nations - yet Hillary Clinton is nowhere near giving up. Years ago, one of Bill Clinton's biographers described his approach to government as a \"permanent campaign\", and it appears to be his wife's preferred form of existence as well. If there is one constant in Clinton's life, it is that she never throws in her cards, whether what motivates her is power or public service. \"Never, never!\" she exclaims, when I ask whether she ever thought of walking off into the wings after the frustrations and indignities of her time at the White House. \"I have a very realistic sense of what high- stakes politics requires and it took me a while to get there because it's shocking when you are in the arena but once you figure it out, you can take it seriously for purposes of analysis and understanding, but you can't take it personally.\" Such treatment seems to rankle all the same. She's been listening to coverage ahead of the British debate and is plainly irritated by the coverage of the leaders' wives. \"Whether a woman's running for office or she's supporting her husband who's running for office and she gets criticised for wearing open-toed shoes or for the colour of her coat, there's just a lot of history that you bear if you are a woman who puts herself out in the political arena,\" she says. Another country Clinton boards her official 727 to fly from São Paulo to Costa Rica Injustice towards women appears to be the issue that most enthuses Clinton in this job as in her many other incarnations in American public life, whether as First Lady or before. \"I feel passionately it is in not just the American national security interests but the world's, that women be given the opportunities and the tools to make the most out of their own lives,\" she says. In the 1990s she steered clear of reading the newspapers because of the way she was treated. Today, she says, \"I certainly don't read coverage of me, I read what else is going on that I need to know about to do my job.\" \"It's all baloney,\" says Philippe Reines, her press adviser, who set up the meeting with her and is sitting to one side in her office. \"Yeah, yeah, right, that's what he tells me,\" Clinton responds. I wonder. She may not read the stories about her, but she has boosted her domestic profile still further by talking to American magazines such as Esquire, Vogue and Parade. To what end? Clinton has said she will only serve one four-year term as secretary of state - understandable, given the grind of the job. When I ask whether she expects a woman president in the next decade or so, she responds: \"I'd love that, obviously I would love that. I want to be front and centre when it happens.\" \"Any chance it would be you?\" I ask. \"No, no, I don't think that's in the cards,\" Clinton says. She's given more categoric denials in the past. \"I think that there's a whole generation of young women and not so young, but mature, seasoned women who are earning their stripes and recognising how tough it is out there. It is not for the faint of heart to run for president, and I believe it is harder for women, it just is, and that's just a fact.\" But, says one US official, \"all the profiles and all this media treatment undercut the argument that she is finished with electoral politics. Why do all this stuff? She's already Hillary Clinton. You have to ask: 'What's the idea behind raising her domestic profile still further?\" Indeed she is now, by some counts, the most popular politician in America and some in Washington say she could be a good fit for the vice-presidential slot in the 2012 elections. Back in São Paulo, once the town hall meeting is over, Clinton faces a seven-hour flight to Costa Rica. The journey goes on and on, and as saleswoman-in-chief for the US in an unruly world, she faces a long, hard road. Today the US sometimes struggles to assert itself on the world stage. But the obstacles are rather fewer if the product she is pitching is herself. A secretary of state like none before her, Hillary Clinton, long one of the most formidable figures in US politics, is looking stronger than ever. Daniel Dombey is the FT's US diplomatic correspondent David Miliband: \"Hillary is a rock star she has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour\" It's too early to start chalking up a scorecard because Hillary Clinton, and the Obama administration, is laying the foundations for long-term change in America's foreign policy. The challenges are immense probably more difficult than the inheritance of any previous administration. But American leadership is essential and a commitment to multilateralism in fact multi, multilateralism using different and overlapping forums - is real and right. You also have to remember that Hillary is a rock star. When I arrived at the Nato Foreign Ministers meeting in March 2009, it was a nice surprise that all the staff, never mind the press, seemed to have turned out in droves for my arrival. Then I realised that Hillary was 10 minutes behind me. That said, the thing that most surprised me about working with Clinton was not her intelligence or her hard work, all of which are well known, but that behind the serious exterior is someone who has a great sense of fun, and a great sense of humour. She has seen politics from all sides, and can laugh at herself as well as at others. She's a remarkably good listener, always synthesising ideas and opinions to develop her own. She thinks strategically as well as tactically. She's also very, very unpompous. Hillary is a very political person but in a particular way, she honours politics and public service and believes that democratic politics is not a necessary evil, but a calling of value and vocation. She knows you win some and you lose some, but it's essential to take part. There's one other thing. Hillary is a people person in that she thinks deeply about the psychology of the people she's dealing with. Their motivation, their loyalties, their culture. It's real emotional intelligence in trying to understand why people disagree and how you can get them to agree. I think that must be why so many other members of the administration say she is a very good colleague. David Miliband is shadow foreign secretary Gideon Rachman: \"Relations between the White House and the State Department are not particularly close\" A school teacher asked to write a report on Hillary Clinton's stint as secretary of state would have to give her 10/10 for effort but a rather more modest mark for actual achievements - maybe a six or a seven. Secretaries of state are generally judged on two criteria. First, how have they done in the endless bureaucratic turf wars that characterise Washington politics? Second, how effective have they been in promoting US foreign policy in the wider world? Success in one area usually helps in the other. Henry Kissinger was a superb Washington infighter - and his close relationship with President Nixon made him all the more effective overseas. Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, was widely admired outside the US - but came out on the wrong side of many of the Washington battles, which limited his ability to get things done in the wider world. Hillary Clinton has skilfully avoided being sucked into the debilitating Washington struggles that so damaged Powell. Despite the often poisonous rivalry between the Obama and Clinton camps during the campaign, Clinton has a good working relationship with the president. But while relations between the White House and the State Department are cordial, they do not seem to be particularly close. Clinton appointed many loyalists from her own campaign to the State Department, with the result that State is rather detached from Obama's inner circle. Obama's penchant for making high-profile speeches in foreign capitals such as Cairo, Prague, Tokyo and Istanbul means that the president himself has done more than anyone else to define his administration's approach to the world. That still leaves a role for Clinton to fill in the crucial details of policy. But special representatives have been appointed to deal with Afghanistan and the Middle East - and the Treasury is critical to China policy. Asked about Clinton's impact as secretary of state, one senior European policymaker purses his lips and says: \"She's done some great trips, and she's highly professional. But it's hard to see any particular area where she has really driven policy.\" Gideon Rachman is the FT's chief foreign affairs columnist David Rothkopf: \"When she has been asked to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly\" Hillary Clinton has been a cautious secretary of state: she has protected the president well and pursued his agenda without upstaging him an early concern, given her stature. She has worked very well with other members of the cabinet, and is reconsidering the role and structure of the State Department. That includes a review of the role of diplomacy going forward. Clinton has not only acknowledged the rise of new powers and a changing global power structure but has taken steps to reshape US foreign policy structure accordingly. An important part of that has been recognising the importance of co-operating with private and non-state actors such as NGOs, as well as dealing with non-state threats. When the administration has called upon her to deliver tough messages, she has done so unflinchingly. This has allowed the president to articulate a strategic vision which Clinton then goes about implementing. Still, neither the secretary of state nor the president determines the global situation. The US may be the most powerful country in the world but it is one among many powerful countries, and many aspects of the situation we face today are beyond our control. The Obama administration has been dealt an extremely difficult hand: not only Iraq and Afghanistan, but Iran and North Korea's nuclear programmes, the rise of emerging powers and a complex and still unfolding series of financial crises. We have gone from a world in which the US thought it had limitless resources and unbounded options to one where the limits are clear; from a world in which you could work in the G8 to one where you have to work in the context of the G20; a world where new technologies and new powers play a bigger role. All of those things would dictate a change in foreign policy regardless of who is in office. Hillary Clinton has established a very solid foundation. The next step is to identify a couple of signature issues and have a couple of signature successes. That will take her to the next level.

    "text": "Rahm's long goodbye\nBy: Glenn Thrush\nJune 22, 2010 04:34 AM EDT\nFor all the talk about Rahm Emanuel reaching for the \"eject\" button, the fiery White House\nchief of staff isn't leaving in the immediate future - and could serve well into 2011,\naccording to people close to him.\n\"It's the opinion in the top levels of the White House that Rahm is going to be here longer\nthan many people think,\" said a senior administration official, speaking on condition of\nanonymity.\nSpeculation about Emanuel's departure has been a favorite parlor game for nearly a year\nstoked by Emanuel's admission that he'd love to run for Chicago mayor (should current\nMayor Richard Daley retire, of course), his own kvetching about the rigors of the job,\nwithering attacks on him from the left and the right and the fact that the average expiration\ndate on a chief of staff is 18 months.\nEmanuel is leaving, but his departure date has proved to be profoundly elastic. Friends\nand co-workers said he vacillates from day to day, sometimes minute to minute. He might\nleave in December after the midterms; or he might stay until next summer, depending on\nwhether Daley runs or President Barack Obama asks him to stick around, they said.\nAnd even as he pines for his native Chicago, Emanuel continues to put down real roots in\nD.C., recently writing the check to enroll his children in the exclusive Maret School in\nWashington through the 2011 school year, according to a person close to Emanuel.\nHe's shown few signs of loosening his grip on the tiller - bombarding White House\nstaffers with long-distance calls during the first days of the Gulf oil spill even as he\ntraveled in Israel for his son's bar mitzvah.\nAnd in a broader sense, it's hard to imagine Emanuel's huge personality extracted from\nthe political, journalistic and bar stool life of Obama's Washington.\nTake the last game of last week's NBA Finals, when any American voter could wander\ninto Tunnicliff's Tavern on Capitol Hill and witness one of the most powerful men in the\nnation egging on the Boston Celtics screaming at the flat-screen TV, actually - joined\nby a merry band that included Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.); Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.);\nJim Manley, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.); and a pair of\nfavorite reporters from The New York Times and The Washington Post.\nDespite a British tabloid story asserting that Emanuel is sick of Obama's \"idealism\" and is\nracing for the exit, the former Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman\nstill loves the attention and power of his current job and hasn't made up his mind when\nhe's leaving, people who know him said.\n\"This is BS. And if you need it for translation, it is baseless,\" Emanuel said in a statement\npushing back against a story in the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph portraying Emanuel as restless\nand fed up.\nReplacing Emanuel, when he eventually goes, will be no easy task for Obama and the\nsmall clique of close advisers led by Pete Rouse, David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett.\nFor one thing, Obama and company need to know what the post-November political\nlandscape looks like before picking a successor: If Republicans take back one or more\nhouse of Congress, the new chief of staff will need to know how to leverage executive\npower against a hostile Hill; if Democrats retain their majorities, Emanuel's successor will\nneed some of his legislative skills.\nBarring a major course correction, Obama, who prizes loyalty and familiarity, isn't likely to\nreach too far outside his inner circle, advisers said.\nStill, the president is increasingly cognizant of his reputation for insularity and would quite\nlikely give a serious look at respected former Clinton chiefs of staff Leon Panetta, currently\nhead of the CIA, or John Podesta, who runs the Center for American Progress, a major\nliberal think tank with close ties to the administration.\nRouse, a senior adviser who served as Obama's Senate chief of staff, is considered the\nbest pure manager in the White House and a logical choice to replace Emanuel, according\nto a half-dozen administration officials and consultants.\nBut Rouse's colleagues say the quiet 60-year-old insider loves his work, the Grateful Dead\nand his cats but despises the spotlight and would most likely turn down the job unless\nObama insisted.\n\"The key thing about Pete is that the president trusts him and would feel very, very\ncomfortable with him in charge,\" said a Democratic consultant who knows both men well.\n\"But he probably won't take it.\"\nOne possible candidate - deputy chief of staff Jim Messina, Emanuel's political go-to guy\nis likely to play a major role in Obama's 2012 reelection campaign and is expected to\nmove to Chicago sometime next year.\nIn Messina's absence, another Emanuel favorite Deputy National Security Adviser Tom\nDonilon has emerged as a possible successor, according to people close to the\nsituation.\nObama has been impressed by Donilon's presentations at the President's Daily Briefing,\nand the Rhode Island native has a wide variety of political and governmental experience,\nserving as a congressional liaison under President Jimmy Carter, chief State Department\nspokesman under President Bill Clinton and a campaign adviser who helped Obama\nprepare for debates against John McCain.\nOne major Donilon drawback: He served as an executive vice president for Fannie Mae,\nthe bailed-out mortgage giant, and reportedly lobbied against stronger regulatory\noversight.\nDavid Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, is another contender, with a reputation\nfor discipline, team building and solid management skills. But Plouffe has been reluctant to\nsettle down in Washington, is earning a stellar living as a consultant and hates the press.\nFormer Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle is also a possible successor, even though\nhis nomination for Health and Human Services secretary was scuttled by revelations he\nfailed to report limo rides paid for by a corporate client.\nAnother White House aide, Phil Schiliro, is a favorite of Obama's for his legislative savvy\nand political instincts. But critics said he lacks the range of policy and political experience.\nthat other candidates possess, and that his mastery of the Hill won't mean much if\nDemocrats surrender their majorities in either house.\nThen there's Ron Klain, 49, Vice President Joe Biden's brainy and politically astute chief\nof staff, who is said to be intensely interested in making the move from the Eisenhower\nExecutive Office Building to the West Wing.\nKlain - who also served as Al Gore's chief of staff is well-regarded inside the White\nHouse. Plus, he's got a touch of star power: Kevin Spacey played him in the HBO movie\n\"Recount,\" about his role in guiding the Gore campaign through the 2000 Florida recount.\nKlain's downside: He's essentially an outsider who has yet to develop a serious rapport\nwith the president, according to insiders.\n©2010 Capitol News Company, LLC",

    "text": "As you know, the EU-IMF-USG consensus hope motivating the Greek bailout is that it will buy time for Spain, Portugal, etc. From widening credit spreads to falling stock prices, most relevant market indicators are responding with doubt. Former IMF Chief Economist and NYT Columnist (and influential blogger for bond traders) Simon Johnson has an important rejoinder to this consensus hope in today's NYT, full text pasted below.\n\nAs the EU has no playbook for most of the pressing questions it faces, my staff is working to brainstorm as to the least bad of what are only sobering options.\n\nThis is long but worth it.\n\nMay 6, 2010, 6:11 amit's Not About Greece AnymoreBy PETER BOONE AND SIMON JOHNSONLouisa Gouliamaki/Agence France-Presse Getty Images Protesters waved flags from the Acropolis archaeological site behind banners in English and Greek hung in front of the Parthenon temple in Athens. Peter Boone is chairman of the charity Effective Intervention and a research associate at the Center for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. He is also a principal in Salute Capital Management Ltd. Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, is the co-author of \"13 Bankers.\"The Greek \"rescue\" package announced last weekend is dramatic, unprecedented and far from enough to stabilize the euro zone. The Greek government and the European Union leadership, prodded by the International Monetary Fund, are finally becoming realistic about the dire economic situation in Greece. They have abandoned previous rounds of optimistic forecasts and have now admitted to a profoundly worse situation. This new program calls for \"fiscal adjustments\" cuts to the fiscal deficit, mostly through spending cuts totaling 11 percent of gross domestic product in 2010, 4.3 percent in 2011, and 2 percent in 2012 and 2013. The total debt-to-G.D.P. ratio peaks at 149 percent in 2012-13 before starting a gentle glide path back down to sanity. This new program is honest enough to show why it is unlikely to succeed. Daniel Gros, an eminent economist on euro zone issues based in Brussels, has argued that for each 1 percent of G.D.P. decline in Greek government spending, total demand in the country falls by 2.5 percent of G.D.P. If the government reduces spending by 15 percent of G.D.P. - the initial shock to demand could be well over 30 percent of G.D.P.Obviously this simple rule does not work with such large numbers, but it illustrates that Greece is likely to experience a very sharp recession and there is substantial uncertainty around how bad the economy will get. The program announced last weekend assumes Greek G.D.P. falls by 4 percent this year, then by another 2.6 percent in 2011, before recovering to positive growth in 2012 and beyond. Such figures seem extremely optimistic, particularly in the face of the civil unrest now sweeping Greece and the deep hostility expressed toward Greece in some northern European policy circles. The pattern of growth is critical because, under this program, Greece needs to grow out of its debt problem soon. Greece's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio will be a debilitating 145 percent at the end of 2011. Now consider putting more realistic growth figures into the I.M.F. forecast for Greece's economy - e.g., with G.D.P. declining 12 percent in 2011, then the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio may reach 155 percent. At these levels, with a 5 percent real interest rate and no growth, the country needs a primary surplus at 8 percent of G.D.P. to keep the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio stable. It will be nowhere near that level. The I.M.F. program has Greece running a primary budget deficit of around 1 percent of G.D.P. in that year, and that assumes a path for Greek growth that can be regarded only as an \"upside scenario.\"The politics of these implied budget surpluses remains brutal. Since most Greek debt is held abroad, roughly 80 percent of the budget savings the Greek government makes go straight to Germans, French and other foreign\n\ndebt holders (mostly banks). If growth turns out poorly, will the Greeks be prepared for ever-tougher austerity to pay the Germans? Even if everything goes well, Greek citizens seem unlikely to welcome this version of their \"new normal.\"\n\nLast week the European leadership panicked very late in the day - when it realized that the euro zone itself was at risk of a meltdown. If the euro zone proves unwilling to protect a member like Greece from default, then bond investors will run from Portugal and Spain also - if you doubt this, study carefully the interlocking debt picture published recently in The New York Times. Higher yields on government debt would have caused concerns about potential bank runs in these nations, and then spread to more nations in Europe. When there is such a \"run,\" it is not clear where it stops. In the hazy distance, Belgium, France, Austria and many others were potentially at risk.\n\nEven the Germans cannot afford to bail out those nations. Slapped in the face by this ugly scenario, the Europeans decided to throw everything they and the I.M.F. had at bailing out Greece. The program as announced has only a small chance of preventing eventual Greek bankruptcy, but it may still slow or avert a dangerous spiral downward - and enormous collateral damage in the rest of Europe. The I.M.F. floated in some fashion an alternative scenario with a debt restructuring, but this was rejected by both the European Union and the Greek authorities. This is not a surprise; leading European policy makers are completely unprepared for broader problems that would follow a Greek \"restructuring,\" because markets would immediately mark down the debt (i.e., increase the yields) for Portugal, Spain, Ireland and even Italy. The fear and panic in the face of this would be unparalleled in modern times: When the Greeks pay only 50 percent on the face value of their debt, what should investors expect from the Portuguese and Spanish? It all becomes arbitrary, including which countries are dragged down. Someone has to decide who should be defended and at what cost, and the European structures are completely unsuited to this kind of tough decision-making under pressure.In the extreme downside scenario, Germany is the only obvious safe haven within the euro zone, so its government bond yields would collapse while other governments face sharply rising yields. The euro zone would likely not hold together. There is still a narrow escape path, without immediate debt default and the chaos that that would produce:-\n\nTalk down the euro moving toward parity with the American dollar would help lift growth across the euroz one..\n\nAs the euro falls, bond yields will rise on the euro zone periphery. This will create episodes of panic. Enough short-term financing must be in place to support the rollover of government debt..\n\nOnce the euro has fallen a great deal, announce the European Central Bank will support the euro at those levels (i.e., prevent appreciation, with G-20 tacit agreement), and also support the peripheral euro zone nations viewed as solvent by buying their bonds whenever markets are chaotic..\n\nAt that stage, but not before, the euro zone leadership needs to push weaker governments to restructure. That will include Greece and perhaps also Portugal. Hopefully, in this scenario Spain can muddle through..\n\nEuropean banks should be recapitalized as necessary and have most of their management replaced. This is a massive failure of euro groupthink - including most notably at the political level - but there is no question that bank executives have not behaved responsibly in a long while and should be replaced en masse. To the extent possible, some of the ensuing losses should be shared with bank creditors. But be careful what you wish for. The bankers are powerful for a reason; they have built vital yet fragile structures at the heart of our economies. Dismantle with care.",

    "text": "Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at Lib-Dem headquarters against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe. But Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it appears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has also misplayed almost every turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience (derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance (from no less a privileged background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he went to Westminster instead of Eton and has a less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral, because of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).\n\nWhat about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other parties (Scottish National Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand progressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the LDs. Gordon has said he will allow Clegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its terms giving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting whatever harsh pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a sectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle with Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has wrung a pledge from Borwn that if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary. Meanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being forward as a strong party man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David look ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming to a leadership contest afterward, when Peter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed Miliband, David's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if Brown loses. Ed has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than uncertain. But before that eventuality Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet Shaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London Times polls just out says 62 percent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more than discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.\n\nWhat about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the election was leaked this morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes an anti-Europe line of the new government. (I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere inside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the Tory moneyman, who spent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win outright, failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc. Many agree with the evil Ashcroft. But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with Clegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now, do whatever deal can be done, maintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a new election, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by Tories as proof that the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the radical right as the children of Thatcher for five years. The Tories would then move on their electoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament, redistricting in Conservative favor, and trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.\n\nWhat about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition, probably the only chance for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of power forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously lean toward the Tories, having little to do with policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be feckless and weak as they always have been.\n\nSo, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for hauge, who is deeply anti-European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI, already announced, would cause havoc with peace and economic recovery. I'd send a private message asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it is. Tilt publicly to Merkel on Europe for this reason among others.\n\nArticle below:\nTory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret hardline memo on Europe\n• Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough stance on EU\n• Leak follows leaders' 'constructive, amicable' meeting\nToby Helm and Anushka Asthana\n• The Observer, Sunday 9 May 2010\n\nThe document, obtained by the Observer, is headed \"draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime Minister\" and was written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how Hague intended to adopt a tough approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels tomorrow.\n\nIn the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how his message would be that \"the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election\" to one firmly against any further integration.\n\nExposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative leadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal justice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government - demands many EU leaders say they would resist.\n\nHague planned to tell his EU counterparts: \"Rest assured that we seek engagement, not confrontation. But our aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament.\" He would also tell his first foreign ministers' meeting \"we will never join the euro\" and conclude: \"You will find us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and straight-talking.\"\n\nLast night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it was drawn up on the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The document came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party figures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged from Thursday's general election with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.\n\nCameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to thrash out a power-sharing deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were \"constructive and amicable\". The 70-minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in Whitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as \"constructive and amicable\".\n\nTory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the beginning of the coming week at the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver Letwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and David Laws.\n\nBut the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his criticism of the Conservatives' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will limit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the 21st century.\n\nThe document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that their pro-Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem spokesman said the party was strongly pro-European, but would not be drawn on the document.",

Should invite him back to see her.\n\nFrom Foster Care To Law School Graduate, Howard University\nStudent Beats The Odds\n\nJelani Freeman lived in 6 foster homes in 10 years\n\nUpdated: Friday, 07 May 2010, 8:25 PM EDT\nPublished: Friday, 07 May 2010, 7:55 PM EDT\n\nBy BETH PARKER/myfoxdc\n\nWASHINGTON - Jelani Freeman has gone through a lot to wear this robe. This weekend, he will graduate from Howard University Law\nSchool.\n\nHe remembers the shaky foundation of his young life. A mother who could not take care of him. He lived in six foster homes in ten\nyears.\n\n\"Moving to these different homes. The kids were like 'you weren't here yesterday.' Where's your mom at?\" said Freeman.\n\nAt 18 years old, he left the system and went to college in search of room and board. He knew what people expected of kids in the foster\ncare system - not much.\n\n\"All I would hear is that they were in jail or homeless or weren't doing too well,\" said Freeman.\n\nHe beat the odds and graduated, but he felt ... alone.\n\n\"I can distinctly remember walking across the stage in undergrad. You know at graduation everyone has their cheer section that yells as\nyou walk across the stage and there was almost silence as I walked across,\" said Freeman.\n\nIt will be different this time. When Freeman gets his diploma Saturday at the convention center, there will be 26 people - friends and\nsupporters from as far away as California - in D.C. to show their support.\n\nFreeman also got a boost from an internship program for kids who have spent time in foster care. He was placed in the office\nof then Senator Hillary Clinton. Clinton even mentions him in the updated version of her book \"It Takes A Village.\"\nNow, he may use his law degree to work on public policy - especially children's issues. He wants all kids to know: \"There's a bright\nfuture out there for you if you stay focused and work hard.\"\n\nAnd to the adults who hear his story, Freeman said help a child. He is living proof of the difference it can make.",

We whittled down this list to three people who\nhave qualifications that we believe are necessary for the job: a deep understanding of and support for UNFPA's\nreproductive health/family planning mission and its critical role in implementing the ICPD Program of Action, strong\nleadership and advocacy skills, and strong management ability to oversee an organization with over 2000 employees\nworldwide.\n\nWe see the leading candidates as:\n\nUSUN concurs and is in touch with the SG's office to convey our views. The SG will make his own shortlist based on a UN\nreview panel's recommendations. He is expected to announce his selection in October to allow the designee some\noverlap with the incumbent, Thoraya Obaid, whose term expires at the end of the year.

(I've discussed with Shaun.)\n\nNorthern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public\nsector spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles.\nPolitical stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community\npolicing, creating a vacuum that the Real IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the\npublic sector would make it difficult to increase private sector investment. Does the new government\nunderstand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the situation?\nDefense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into\ngovernment programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek\nclaficiation on exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and\nover what schedule? How will cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?\nTrident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats\nallows the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have\ntheir way: marriage tax allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear\ndeterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear\ndeterrent. How will this actually work in practice?\nPolitical Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has\nproposed to pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore\n establishes that a vote of no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek\nHague's view on how this will work.",

In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having\nderailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to\n\"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable\" (all translations are\nmine).\nAccording to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be \"Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them,\nand distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.\"\nNetanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after\nstepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the\nPalestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the\nUnited States would let such an attack come to fruition.\n\"I know what America is,\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right\ndirection. They won't get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian,\" and\nwent on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would\nbe allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could\ntorpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that.\n\"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords],\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would, but ... I'm going\nto interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.\nHow did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far\nas I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\"\nSmiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let\nIsrael alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"He didn't want to give\nme that letter,\" Netanyahu said, \"so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to\nthe Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that\nmeeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment\non, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords.\"\nPresident Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape\nonline here.",

She called the\nMillennium Challenge Corporation \"pathetically underfunded,\" lamented that no one seems to know who's in\ncharge of big initiatives on food security and global health, and complained that USAID still has vacancies for\nseveral senior staff positions.\n\nBirdsall's calls for giving USAID total independence and cabinet-level status aren't likely to be final\nrecommendations from either the White House or the State Department.\n\nBut her overall anxiety about USAID's status is widely shared in the development community. A team of top\ndevelopment leaders including former USAID administrator Brian Atwood wrote today to protest the cuts in\nthe foreign aid budget that Congress is calling for.\n\n\"We are grateful for the emphasis the President has placed on development and foreign assistance a tradition he\ncontinues from President Bush. And we strongly support Secretary Clinton's call to make USAID 'the premier\ndevelopment agency in the world,' they wrote. \"But this goal will only be achieved when USAID's personnel capacit\nis rebuilt and its funding enhanced.\"\n\nWorld Food Prize Laureate Rev. David Beckmann, who co-chairs the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network\n(MFAN), told The Cable, \"The Obama administration is doing smart and creative things to help hungry and poor\naround the world. But they are hung up by organizational confusion, and the president needs to make it clea\nthat USAID, not the State Department, has lead responsibility for development.\"\n\nMFAN even has a running counter on its website tracking the days since President Obama pledged to release his\noverall development policy.\n\nAdding to the concern is the fact that two of the lead officials who are in charge of the QDDR will be departing the\nState Department soon. Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew has been tapped to become the next director of the\nWhite House's Office of Management and Budget. Policy Planning chief Anne Marie Slaughter has made it\nknown that her two-year leave from Princeton will require her to return to New Jersey at the end of the year.\n\nState Department officials assure The Cable that the QDDR will be completed before Lew and Slaughter leave Fogg\nBottom.

A team of top\ndevelopment leaders including former USAID administrator Brian Atwood wrote today to protest the cuts in\nthe foreign aid budget that Congress is calling for.\n\n\"We are grateful for the emphasis the President has placed on development and foreign assistance a tradition he\ncontinues from President Bush. And we strongly support Secretary Clinton's call to make USAID 'the premier\ndevelopment agency in the world,' they wrote. \"But this goal will only be achieved when USAID's personnel capacit\nis rebuilt and its funding enhanced.\"\n\nWorld Food Prize Laureate Rev. David Beckmann, who co-chairs the Modernizing Foreign Assistance Network\n(MFAN), told The Cable, \"The Obama administration is doing smart and creative things to help hungry and poor\naround the world. But they are hung up by organizational confusion, and the president needs to make it clea\nthat USAID, not the State Department, has lead responsibility for development.\"\n\nMFAN even has a running counter on its website tracking the days since President Obama pledged to release his\noverall development policy.\n\nAdding to the concern is the fact that two of the lead officials who are in charge of the QDDR will be departing the\nState Department soon. Deputy Secretary of State Jack Lew has been tapped to become the next director of the\nWhite House's Office of Management and Budget. Policy Planning chief Anne Marie Slaughter has made it\nknown that her two-year leave from Princeton will require her to return to New Jersey at the end of the year.\n\nState Department officials assure The Cable that the QDDR will be completed before Lew and Slaughter leave Fogg\nBottom. Nevertheless, the delays are having an own effect of their own, said Birdsall.\n\n\"Time is not on our side,\" she told The Cable in an interview. \"We're missing in action as a country.\"\n\nYou are subscribed to email updates from The Cable\nTo stop receiving these emails, you may unsubscribe now.\nGoogle Inc., 20 West Kinzie, Chicago IL USA 60610\nEmail delivery powered by",

    "subject": "Re: Corker",
    "text": "And pasted below is the exchange between Corker and Holbrooke:\n\nCORKER:\nMr. Chairman, thank you.\nI want to thank the ambassador for coming. I know he has a wealth of knowledge and certainly served our country for many years.\nA number of us wrote a letter to you asking for this hearing, and my guess is you might have had hearings any way. But the reason we wrote the letter -- bipartisan letter was to provide Congress and the American people with a definition of the end state for our civilian operations in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the civilian mission, and a detailed plan for achieving those objectives, and the very specific, measurable metrics being used to measure progress towards achieving those objectives. I have to say, I've been here for an hour and 10 minutes. I have heard nothing -- nothing -- about that. And while I respect the ambassador, I've heard a lot of process. I've heard a lot about meetings. I have no earthly idea no earthly idea what our objectives are on the civilian front. And I don't know if you have time to begin doing that right now, but this has so far been an incredible waste of time, from the standpoint of -- of hearing, though. And I have tremendous respect for you, but maybe we have the wrong witness. I hope we'll have maybe Secretary Clinton and Eikenberry, maybe Crocker. I know he's supposed to come. But could you answer the question that was the purpose of these hearings in the first place?\n\nHOLBROOKE:\nI'm sorry. You don't feel that I've told you what our civilian programs are?\n\nCORKER:\nYou've told me a lot of process. I'd like to know a definition of what our end state is for civilian operations, the very question we asked when we set this hearing up, is in Afghanistan, clear objectives for the -- for the -- detailed plan for achieving those. I'd like to hear you talk about that. I mean, I'm glad we have a lot of interagency folks here, but I'm not hearing anything that talks about where we're going. I'd also like to know how the withdrawal date that's been set affects that and how it affects those we're working with in the country.\n\nHOLBROOKE:\nFirst of all, Senator Corker, I believe I have discussed our civilian programs in very considerable detail within the constraints of time, but we did prepare a report for this committee earlier this year, which was entered into the record and which I will be happy to enter into the record again, if you wish. And you can go through every one of the programs. The reason I brought my colleagues with me was to show that this was a whole-of-government, an unprecedented effort. Now, on the specifics, since you want specifics, Afghanistan is an agricultural country. It exported agricultural products until 1978 and the Soviet invasion. We are trying to rebuild it. This was not being done for the first seven years of this war. We have -- your -- your committee has given us a great deal of money for agriculture. And we are spending it wisely in a joint AID- USDA effort, which Senator Lugar has particularly been involved in, food, seeds, cash-for-work programs, encouraging alternatives to opium production. Secondly, rule of law. We are spending -- we are spending the money you have authorized for us to create a justice system which can cut into the Taliban's propaganda about corruption and lack of a justice system. Third, counter-narcotics. We have ended poppy eradication, a radical change, because all we were doing by eradicating poppy seeds, poppy crops, was driving farmers, poor farmers, into the hands of the Taliban. Fourth, a major program of subnational governance, where we are putting aid directly to the district level. Fifth, a major effort in specific areas, some of which were alluded to earlier, such as electricity for Kandahar. Senator Kerry asked earlier about Kandahar. One of the major issues here is to bring electricity to the people as a benefit of the international presence. The whole range of activities we have is designed to support the country and to support General Petraeus' counter-insurgency effort. He and I -- I was his counterpart until two weeks ago when he moved to Kabul. I have worked intimately in an effort to create a joint civilian-military effort. And I am happy to provide you with every detail you wish in private briefings on behalf of me and my team. Point number two in regard to the end state issue you raised. I want to be clear on the difference between end state and exit strategy. If we -- this is my personal view, senator -- but if we walk away from Afghanistan, again, as we did 21 years ago, the consequences will be similarly catastrophic, because of the unique strategic position of Afghanistan and the reaction that would have in Pakistan, China, India and the country to Afghanistan's west, Iran, as well as the larger region that includes Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and even extending to Western Europe, which is concerned about terrorism from that region, just as much as we are. So, I hope that when we talk about end state, we talk about a sustainable end state which involves continued American economic and development assistance, and we continue to fulfill our obligations to train the police and the military. This will not be cheap. But it will be a fraction of the money that is now being authorized and appropriated for the military campaign. When we will be able to transition to that is impossible for me or anyone to say. But it won't be on a single day. It will be a gradual process. And that is what the review in December and the president's decision-making will focus on.\n\nCORKER:\nIn our foreign policy, generally speaking -- I know we've had some rough times over the last several years -- it's been something that we've been able to address in a bipartisan way. And I think that the issues that you're dealing with, that we're dealing with in Afghanistan are incredibly tough. I still don't -- I haven't understood what the administration was saying in the beginning. That's not to be critical of them. I just don't understand. I still don't understand. I've met with you and your staff over at the State Department. It's just incredibly vague to me. And I think what we are doing, we have partners, which include the Pakistanis and everybody around, that they don't know what we're doing. They don't know when we're leaving. They think we're leaving shortly, I think. We've just had colleagues who have come from there. We've had a we've got a president there that's having to play both sides, because he wants to survive, because he doesn't know what our intentions are. The Pakistanis don't know what our intentions are, I don't think. And they're making accommodations on both sides. So, I just have to tell you, I send letters to parents and spouses. And what I feel because of this lack of clarity is that we are in Afghanistan, because we're in Afghanistan, and that we don't have the will to be successful. And we don't have the will to leave, because of some of the things you just outlined. But I just don't hear any clarity. And again, I want to support the administration. I want to support you, because that's what we need to do as a country, is let the shores (ph) align (ph), let the partisanship. But I have to tell you, as a person who wants to do that, I still don't understand. OK? And I have average intelligence, so I would ask you to, please -- or maybe let's have some witnesses in here that can shed more light or be more specific. But I don't understand, and I'm very concerned.\n\nHOLBROOKE:\nAnd I think we're sending a lot of mixed signals. And I think there's a lot of dissension. Actually, as I listen to you, even within the administration itself, and that has to end. And I just ask you, please. You have a lot of experience, help us understand. You haven't done that today. And I would ask the chairman to please have some witnesses come in and explain to us what the end state is, what we can envision Afghanistan being whenever this withdrawal does take place, because I still do not understand. We've changed it. Now it's sort of a degraded country where they have conflict, but it's not out of control. I mean, the bar continues to change. And I'm just concerned as an individual, and yet I want us to be, if we can, all on the same page as much as possible. But I think to do that, this has got to be much clearer than has been outlined. Senator, I'm sorry that my answers don't fully satisfy you. But I want to be very clear on this, because I understand your comments and I respect them. First of all, the core question -- the one you are asked by your constituents, and I'm asked by everybody -- why are we in Afghanistan? The short, simple answer is 9/11, direct threats to our national security interests, and the fact that while our enemies against our homeland are on the Pakistani side of the border, this is a single struggle. And we have to strengthen the Afghan government and let -- and teach it to stand on its own feet over time, so that we can move forward, while we do other things that fall outside the scope of this hearing, to dismantle, deter and defeat Al Qaida. Now, if you do not believe that it's a threat to the homeland, then we have an honest difference of opinion. But I think the Times Square bombing incident shows clearly how dangerous that situation is. Secondly, on the civilian mission, again, it's in support of a single, civilian-military, counter-insurgency mission. And we have benchmarks, requested and required by the Congress, and submitted to you. And our overarching goal here is always the same, to disrupt, dismantle and defeat Al Qaida and prevent its ability to threaten the United States. And we believe, all of us -- and there is no division on this in the executive branch -- that the situation we face out there is a direct threat. We believe that before the Times Square situation occurred, and I don't think anything could have proved it more vividly. And to achieve this, we have to degrade the Taliban as well, because they are part of the enemy's structure a different part, but an integral part -- that we face. Now, the Afghan government doesn't yet have the capacity to deal with this on its own. How could they after 30 years of war? And so, the civilian part of it, the things I've just mentioned to you -- police, government capacity, rule of law, subnational government, training provincial officials, women's empowerment and a whole series of other major issues are part of our civilian programs. And we're happy to come back up to your office we appreciated your visit to us -- and continue this dialogue. Our civilian strategy is designed from keeping Al Qaida at bay, and it's designed to help Afghan institutions establish conditions for stable governance. Our plan has these benchmarks, which have been briefed to you and your colleagues, and we're happy to discuss them in detail at any time.",

About Us | Contact | Terms of Service | RSS A New Read on Jewish Life Fibi Netanyahu In 2001, PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords By Liel Leibovitz | Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM Netanyahu in 2001. CREDIT:munel 10 Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. \"I believe Prime Minister Netanyahu wants peace,\" Obama sarg [11. \"I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.\" A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a radically different light. In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to \"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable\" (all translations are mine). According 121 to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be \"Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.\" Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States would let such an attack come to fruition. \"I know what America is,\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction. They won't get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian,\" and went on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that. \"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords],\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\" Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israei alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"They didn't want to give me that letter,\" Netanyahu said, \"so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing. Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords.\" President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape online here [3] Related: Tricky Bibi [2] [Haaretz] Article printed from Tablet Magazine: http://www.tabletmag.com URL to article: http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/39692/fibi-netanyahu/ URLs in this post: [1] said: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html [2] According: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/tricky-bibi-1.302053 [3] here: http://news.nana10.co.il/Article/?ArticleId=731025&sid=126 Click here to print.

    "text": "Have you been dictating to the NYT?? Exactly what you have been emphasizing. AM\n\nFrom: Catanzano, Amanda M\nTo: Slaughter, Anne-Marie\nSent: Mon Jul 19 13:42:09 2010\nSubject: NYT article on tax collection in Pakistan\n\nThought you might find this interesting given S' interest in taxation. I knew Pakistan was bad - but this is shocking. 2%\nof the population paying taxes??? On par with Sierra Leone in tax collection to GDP ratio.\n\nPakistan's Elite Pay Few Taxes, Widening Gap\nBy SABRINA TAVERNISE\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Much of Pakistan's capital city looks like a rich Los Angeles suburb. Shiny sport utility vehicles purr down\ngated driveways. Elegant multistory homes are tended by servants. Laundry is never hung out to dry.\n\nBut behind the opulence lurks a troubling fact. Very few of these households pay income tax. That is mostly because the politicians who\nmake the rules are also the country's richest citizens, and are skilled at finding ways to exempt themselves.\n\nThat would be a problem in any country. But in Pakistan, the lack of a workable tax system feeds something more menacing: a festering\ninequality in Pakistani society, where the wealth of its most powerful members is never redistributed or put to use for public good.

The average worth of Pakistani members of Parliament is $900,000, with its richest member topping $37\nmillion, according to a December study by the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency in Islamabad.\nWhile Pakistan's income from taxes last year was the lowest in the country's history, according to Zafar ul-Majeed, a senior official in\nthe Federal Board of Revenue, the assets of current members of Parliament nearly doubled from those of members of the previous\nParliament, the institute study found.\n\nThe country's top opposition leader, Nawaz Sharif, reported that he paid no personal income tax for three years ending in 2007 in\npublic documents he filed with Pakistan's election commission. A spokesman for Mr. Sharif, an industrialist who is widely believed to be\na millionaire, said he had been in exile and had turned over positions in his companies to relatives.\n\nA month of requests for similar documents for Pakistan's president and prime minister went unanswered by the commission;\nrepresentatives for the men said they did not have the figures.\n\n\"Taxes are the Achilles' heel of Pakistani politicians,\" said Jahangir Tareen, a businessman and member of Parliament who is trying to\nput taxes on the public agenda. He paid $225,534 in income tax in 2009, a figure he made public in Parliament last month. \"If you don't\nhave income, fine, but then don't go and get into a Land Cruiser.\"\n\nThe rules say that anyone who earns more than $3,488 a year must pay income tax, but few do. Akbar Zaidi, a Karachi-based political\neconomist with the Carnegie Endowment, estimates that as many as 10 million Pakistanis should be paying income tax, far more than\nthe 2.5 million who are registered.\n\nOut of more than 170 million Pakistanis, fewer than 2 percent pay income tax, making Pakistan's revenue from taxes among the lowest\nin the world, a notch below Sierra Leone's as a ratio of tax to gross domestic product.\n\nMr. Zaidi blames the United States and its perpetual bailouts of Pakistan for the minuscule tax revenues from rich and poor alike. \"The\nAmericans should say: 'Enough. Sort it out yourselves. Get your house in order first,' \" he argued. \"But you are cowards. You are afraid\nto take that chance.\"\n\nMuch of the tax avoidance, especially by the wealthy, is legal. Under a 1990s law that has become one of the main tools to legalize\nundocumented or illegally obtained money made in Pakistan, authorities here are not allowed to question money transferred from\nabroad. Businessmen and politicians channel billions of rupees through Dubai back to Pakistan, no questions asked.\n\n\"In this country, no one asks, 'How did you get that flat in Mayfair?' \" said Shabbar Zaidi, a partner at A.

On par with Sierra Leone in tax collection to GDP ratio.\n\nPakistan's Elite Pay Few Taxes, Widening Gap\nBy SABRINA TAVERNISE\nISLAMABAD, Pakistan - Much of Pakistan's capital city looks like a rich Los Angeles suburb. Shiny sport utility vehicles purr down\ngated driveways. Elegant multistory homes are tended by servants. Laundry is never hung out to dry.\n\nBut behind the opulence lurks a troubling fact. Very few of these households pay income tax. That is mostly because the politicians who\nmake the rules are also the country's richest citizens, and are skilled at finding ways to exempt themselves.\n\nThat would be a problem in any country. But in Pakistan, the lack of a workable tax system feeds something more menacing: a festering\ninequality in Pakistani society, where the wealth of its most powerful members is never redistributed or put to use for public good. That\nis creating conditions that have helped spread an insurgency that is tormenting the country and complicating American policy in the\nregion.\n\nIt is also a sorry performance for a country that is among the largest recipients of American aid, payments of billions of dollars that prop\nup the country's finances and are meant to help its leaders fight the insurgency.\n\nThough the authorities have tried to expand the net in recent years, taxing profits from the stock market and real estate, entire swaths of\nthe economy, like agriculture, a major moneymaker for the elite, remain untaxed.\n\n\"This is a system of the elite, by the elite and for the elite,\" said Riyaz Hussain Naqvi, a retired government official who worked in tax\ncollection for 38 years. \"It is a skewed system in which the poor man subsidizes the rich man.\"\n\nThe problem starts at the top.

Sid\n\nAlterNet / By Drew Westen\n24 COMMENTS\nWhat Created the Populist Explosion and How\nDemocrats Can Avoid the Shrapnel in\nNovember\n\nTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The only question at this point is how to mitigate the\ndamage when the bomb detonates in November.\nSeptember 1, 2010 |\n\nLIKE THIS ARTICLE?\nJoin our mailing list:\n\nSign up to stay up to date on the latest headlines via email.\n\nPetitions by Change.org Get Widget Start a Petition\nTo say that the American people are angry is an understatement. The political brain of Americans today reflects a volatile\nmixture of fear and fury, and when you mix those together, you get an explosion. The only question at this point is how to\nmitigate the damage when the bomb detonates in November.\nThe bad news is that it's too late for Democrats to do what would have been both good policy and good politics (and what\nthe House actually did do), namely to pass a major jobs bill when it was clear that the private sector couldn't keep\nAmericans employed. The \"Obama Doctrine\" should have been that Americans who want to work and have the ability to\ncontribute to our productivity as a nation should have the right to work, and that if the private sector can't meet the\ndemand for jobs, we have plenty of roads and bridges to fix, new energy sources to develop and manufacture, and\nschools to build and renovate so our kids and workers returning for training can compete in the 21st century global\neconomy. From having spent much of the last four years testing messages on a range of issues, from immigration to\ntaxes and deficits, I can say with some certainty that nothing John Boehner or Eric Cantor could say could come within 30\npoints of generating the enthusiasm -- particularly among swing voters -- of a message that began, \"We don't have a\nshortage of work ethic in this country, we have a shortage of work.\" That message resonates across the political\nspectrum. And it isn't even the strongest message we've tested in the last weeks or months that beats back the toughest\ndeficit-cutting language the other side can muster.\nBut it's too late for that. The administration opted for an alternative doctrine, which Larry Summers enunciated on This\nWeek several months ago: that unemployment is going to remain high for the foreseeable future and eventually come\ndown as if there's nothing we can do about it -- and that they will push here and there for small symbolic measures\nwhose symbolism tends to escape people who are out of work. It's hard to be excited by symbolism when your children\nare hungry or the bank is repossessing your home -- although you didn't do anything to deserve it -- while the people who\ndid are once again making out like bandits.\nAlthough the situation looks bleak for Democrats in November, it ain't over 'til it's over. Republicans are shooting\nthemselves in the foot all over the country, running Tea Party candidates who are so far to the right you can't see Middle\nAmerica from their porch. And some endangered Democrats will likely see victory in November from theirs if they\nunderstand the public mood and speak to it.\nWhat is that public mood? It can be characterized by a single phrase -- populist anger and it cuts across partisan lines.\nOn the right, it is alloyed with racial anxiety and prejudice. On the left, it is alloyed with tremendous disappointment at\nwhat could have been if we had the kind of bold leadership for which times like these cry out. And among people in the\nvast political center, populist anger is alloyed with anxiety and uncertainty -- about their jobs, their homes, and their\nchildren's future.\nHow to Create a Populist Explosion: A Tragedy in Two Acts\nSo how did we get here? The story can be told as a tragedy in two acts.\nAct I: The GOP Sets the Country on a Course of Economic Destruction and the President Calls for Truth and\nReconciliation without the Truth Part\n\n•\nA strong economic downturn devolves into a Great Recession, as the stock market crashes and major banks fail.\nBy October 2008, upper middle class moderate Republicans in the suburbs are so frightened by what's happening\nto their assets that they're willing to give Democrats a chance.\n•\nA Republican administration that believes in neither government nor regulation creates a 700 billion bank bailout\nwith no accountability. Unlike Republicans, who would say \"no\" in a situation like this and let a Great Recession\nturn into a Great Depression, Democrats do the right thing, but they don't make it clear from the start that these\nare Bush Bailouts and remind Americans, over and over, that the cause of all the bankruptcies is the bankruptcy\nof Republican ideology.\n•\nA charismatic young president raises people's hopes and expectations, as he uniquely can. Americans are\nfrightened, but they are willing and waiting to hear an alternative narrative to \"government is the problem, not the\nsolution\" and a path back to economic recovery and security.\n•\nThe White House refuses to tell the American people three stories they desperately need to hear.\n•\nThe first is why the economy has gone into the ditch, and who did it. The president is steadfast in his position that\nwe should \"look forward, not backward,\" even as the GOP is blocking his every initiative to clean up its mess. As\nconservative attacks on him and Democrats increase, he refuses to indict the Republicans in Congress or\nPresident Bush for having destroyed our economy and putting one in eight Americans out of work and one in five\neither behind on their mortgage or in the process of having their homes foreclosed by the same bankers who\ngambled them away. Why did he need to tell the American people who was responsible for their misery -- and to\nrepeat it again and again? Because otherwise, if the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression didn't\nsubside within a year and half, voters would start to associate it with him and his party. This is Neuroscience 101 -\n- it's how mental associations are formed. But the president never even uttered George W. Bush's name in his\nfirst year in office, and the first time he did mention Bush was to appoint him, along with former President Clinton,\nto co-lead American relief efforts in Haiti. The president doesn't like putting antagonists in any of his stories, but if\nforced to, he would cite unnamed \"naysayers,\" \"Washington politics as usual,\" or \"Congress,\" which was\ncounterproductive given that Congress was held by his party. The guiding belief at the White House implicit in this\nmessaging strategy was that Americans have a good grasp on economics and good memories.\n•\nThe second story the American people needed to hear from the president was why deficit spending is essential\nwhen the economy is spiraling downward. It's not a hard story to tell, even in a sound bite. But one of the best\neducators to occupy the Oval Office in decades chose not to educate -- he actually did it once, with prodding, but\nnever repeated what was a superb explanation nor did he remind voters every time his opponents attacked\nhim for deficit spending that they had left him with a 1.2 trillion dollar deficit on the day he walked into office\nbecause of their unpaid-for tax cuts to millionaires and un paid-for war on Iraq that called on no one to sacrifice\nexcept our soldiers and their families (and our kids and grandkids, who will be paying off this war for generations).\nA year later, with Democrats on the ropes, the president started to tell that story. It was the right move, but\nappeared defensive because it hadn't been part of his guiding narrative from the start.\n•\nThe third story the president needed to offer was an alternative narrative on government. The president and his\nparty were about to offer effective government as a solution to multiple problems after 30 years of solid branding\nby conservatives since Ronald Reagan about how government is the problem. But the narrative never came.\n•\nThe White House and Democratic Congress pass what virtually all economists outside the Goldman Sachs-to-\nWashington pipeline consider a half-stimulus that they predict will likely produce half-results. It fulfilled its promise.\nBut the equally predictable political result was a discrediting of the concept of government intervention to\nstimulate the economy in the eyes of the public -- enough to scare off Democratic lawmakers from doing what\nthey learned about Keynesian economics in intro economics for the indefinite future. Instead of blasting the\nRepublicans for having hurled the country toward an abyss that would now take drastic measures to avert and\nwarning the American people that this could easily be the first of two or three trillion-dollar packages that might be\n\nneeded to get Americans back to work and to get the gears of the economy grinding again before we could start\nreturning to the kinds of surpluses Bill Clinton had left the last time a Democrat was in the White House, the\npresident chose to compromise with a party that was so unpopular when he took office that only 20 percent of\nvoters at that point would even admit to a pollster that they considered themselves Republicans -- the lowest point\nfor the GOP since the rise of public opinion polling 50 years earlier.\n•\nThe economy continues its free-fall, shedding 700,000 jobs a month. Meanwhile, Democrats don't take the kind of\ndramatic steps necessary to stop the bleeding. Americans are becoming desperate, but they remain hopeful that\nthis new president will turn things around, and that perhaps the jobs provisions of the new \"stimulus\" act will do\ncauterize the wound. Meanwhile, the stimulus is being portrayed by Republicans as a mixture of pork and fat, and\nno one is effectively answering the charges, creating increasingly negative associations to an act that was never\nadequately crafted or sold.\n•\nThe logical follow-up to a bill designed to pull the economy out of a ditch is to make such a bill unnecessary in the\nfuture, by attacking Wall Street for having thrown us into crisis and passing strong legislation to rein in the\nexcesses that created the economic meltdown. This would have sealed the American people's loyalty to the new\npresident and Congress. (Heading into November, this is, in fact, the most popular piece of legislation the\nDemocrats have passed, but it took them nearly a year and a half to get there, and by then, neither the president\nnor the Democratic Congress enjoyed the good will of the average American.) Instead, the same banks that\nreceived bailouts are foreclosing in record rates on the homeowners whose payroll taxes funded the bailouts but\ndon't seem to get the same kind of attention to their needs from the federal government. Adding insult to injury,\nthe banks double and triple credit card interest rates to as high as 30 percent, including on people's existing credit\ncard debt -- while continuing to receive no-interest loans from the federal government.\n•\nDespite talk of accountability, no one is fired (except one auto executive), virtually no one is prosecuted or even\ninvestigated as far as anyone knows, and banks that received bailouts flaunt record bonuses.\n\nAct II: An Anemic Economy Meets an Anemic Health Care Plan\n\n•\nThe public has been clamoring for health care reform. Over 40 million people don't have health insurance at all,\nand the 85 percent of voters who do have health care have seen their costs double during the Bush years at the\nsame time as real income has declined. Effective narratives on health care are widely available that win by a 2:1\nmargin against the toughest Harry-and-Louise anti-reform language from the other side. The opposition knows it,\nas evident in a leaked memo by Republican wordsmith Frank Luntz, who warns that this will be an uphill climb for\nopponents of reform, who would do well to accept some major elements of it.\n•\nBut instead of using any of the well-tested narratives that were highly effective during the campaign or devising\nany new ones of its own, the administration decides to try to \"sell\" health care without a narrative. (I wrote about\nthis in detail a year ago and will not repeat that history here, except in telegraphic form.) The president refuses to\nstate where he stands on any of the substantive debates about health reform for a year, such as whether we\nshould have a \"public option\" (a term so ill-conceived it's hard to believe the public supported it anyway; imagine\nthe support it might have received if it had been called instead \"the one health care plan the health insurance\ncompanies don't get to control\"). Instead, the White House uses phrases such as \"bending the cost curve\" while\nconservatives flood the airwaves with evocative phrases such as \"government takeover,\" \"a bureaucrat between\nyou and your doctor,\" and \"death panels.\"\n•\nInstead of using Big Pharma and the health insurance industry as the villains of the health care story, which would\nexplain why we need an overhaul rather than a Band-Aid, the White House once again offers a story without\nprotagonists or antagonists, and cuts secret deals with both industries that become public.\n•\nOver interminable months of trying to get the votes of the same Republicans who fought against Medicare for\nseniors for 30 years until the program was just too popular to keep attacking it and who are still trying to gut Social\nSecurity despite its popularity, the public then watches what George Will describes as the \"serial bribery\" of\nRepublican and Democratic Senators alike, as each gets to take his or her turn as the 60th vote.\n•\nAt the 11th hour, as a compromise plan is finally going to pass, the president nixes the idea of a Medicare-like\nalternative Americans can choose over a health-insurance industry plan if they so desire, despite 60 percent of\neven swing voters wanting it included in the bill.\n•\nInstead of being the signature bill that demonstrates both that Democrats can govern effectively and that\ngovernment can be a force for good for working and middle class Americans (who have just been told that the\nbetter plans they've negotiated or been offered for years by their employers are \"Cadillacs\" that are going to be\ntaxed out of existence), the entire process proves to the average American that government can't do anything\nright and scares moderate Democrats away from voting for any other bill that would ever put them on the record\nsupporting government or spending.\n•\n\"Government\" hits an all-time low in the polls, matching the popularity of big corporations, CEOs, and bailouts.\n•\nPopulist anger emerges as the primary emotion across the political spectrum, and the president's job approval\nwith swing voters drops into the high thirties.\n\n•\nFollowing the conventional wisdom, Democrats return to their all-too-familiar defensive crouch, and conclude that\nwhen in trouble, tack right. On health care, the president and his Cabinet fan out all over television to \"reassure\"\nthe public on health care that abortion won't be covered (thanks for the reassurance, but most of us didn't find that\nreassuring), that domestic partners won't be covered, and that immigrants won't be covered. None of these issues\nneeded to be conceded. (I know this because I tested messages on them, and well- messaged progressive\npositions on them would have boosted the popularity of the bill with swing voters.)\n•\nThe White House starts adopting failed conservative policies and talking points that leave the public utterly\nconfused about where the president, and by extension, his party, stands on the central issues of the day. The\npresident talks about cutting deficits and increasing spending in the same breath, using the metaphor of families\ntightening their belt in tough times, which only strengthens resolve against stimulating a faltering economy;\npledges support for massively expanding offshore drilling and \"clean coal\" (which doesn't exist, by the way) in a\nspeech on climate change; and sends in 1200 additional National Guards to Arizona as an apparent reward for\npassing \"No Latino Left Behind,\" while publicly objecting to the legislation.\n•\nThe underlying psychological assumption of these moves is that if you mix policies from the right and left in equal\nparts, you win the center. In fact, no one has ever won the center that way. It appears weak, opportunistic, and\nincoherent to the average swing voter, which is particularly problematic at a time when people in the center\ndesperately want to know that their leaders have a vision and a coherent plan for what to do (which is why both\nFDR and Ronald Reagan were so effective in moving voters in the center). It doesn't win any votes on the right.\nBut it does have one predictable effect: It sucks the motivation out of your base, who feel demoralized and\nbetrayed (if they're part of the \"professional left\") or less likely to vote (if they're average voters who don't follow\npolitics carefully but just don't feel very enthusiastic anymore, even if they don't really know why).\n•\nCapping it all off, the BP disaster occurs two weeks after the president has adopted the \"drill here, drill now,\" \"all\nof the above\" position of the Republican Party and the oil companies. This could have been the perfect\nopportunity to go on the offensive, contrast what Democrats stand for (common sense, protection of our safety,\nthe land we leave our children, and key American industries and jobs, and sticking up for ordinary Americans\nagainst big businesses and their lobbyists) with what Republicans stand for; and connect the dots between what\nhappened on Wall Street (with regulators owned and operated by the companies they were supposed to regulate)\nand what happened in the Gulf (where precisely the same thing happened). Instead, the administration finds itself\non the defensive, increasingly sounding like a subsidiary of BP, allowing BP to call the shots and control\ninformation for weeks, defending increasingly hard-to-believe statistics, and issuing press releases that appear\nindistinguishable from those issued by BP but are inconsistent with assessments of independent scientists.\n\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\nSo that is where we find ourselves today: a Democratic Party and Democratic base that is demoralized and unlikely to\nvote in high numbers in November; a Republican Party that is selling replanted Bushes with tremendous enthusiasm; and\na vast political center filled with voters who are utterly confused and unsure who to turn to but certain that things aren't\ngoing well.\nIn January 2009 no one could have predicted that Democrats would be in this predicament today. Perhaps Democrats\nmight lose a few seats lost in an off-year election, but certainly no more than that. We had just seen -- and the American\npublic knew we had just seen the most disastrous performance by a president and party in living history, and the\nAmerican people had elected a tremendously charismatic young president with enormous Democratic majorities in both\nhouses of Congress. They had given the president and Congress a strong mandate for whatever kind of change was\nnecessary to get us out of economic free-fall and to put Americans back to work.\nBut there were red flags already by the end of Obama's first week in office that led me to offer the following advice to the\nnew administration: Tell the story of how we got in this mess or you'll own it. Tell a coherent story about deficit spending.\nRe-brand government because there's only one story out there now (Reagan's), and it's not one that supports a\nprogressive agenda. Never let attacks go unanswered, because doing so only emboldens your opposition and leads the\npublic to believe that you have no answers to them. And if you throw a bipartisan party and no one comes, don't throw\none. All of what followed has been as predictable as it has been unfortunate. A year and a half later, the White\nHouse hasn't consistently done any of these things, although the President is now intermittently doing some of them, and\nwhen he does, he does them well.\nThe question today is whether Democrats can channel the populist anger we are seeing around the country this late in the\ngame. The answer is that we'd better try. Having recently tested messages on economics and jobs, including how to talk\nabout deficits and taxes -- widely assumed to be Democrats' Achilles Heel, particularly now there is little question that if\nDemocrats and progressives from center to left simply say what they believe in ways that are evocative, values-driven,\nand speak to people's worries and anger, many stand a good chance of surviving November, particularly when their\nopponents have nothing to say other than warmed-over rhetoric about cutting taxes to millionaires and multinationals and\nfiscal restraint except where it cuts into profits of their campaign contributors. Even the most evocative boilerplate\nconservative messages fall flat against honest messages that speak to the need to get Americans working again. And on\nissue after issue, no message is more resonant right now than one that sides with working and middle class Americans\nand small business owners against special interests, big business, and their lobbyists.\n\nBut actions speak louder than words, and Americans want to see action. It may be too late for the kind of jobs bill we\nshould have seen a year and a half ago, but it isn't too late for Democrats to go on the offensive against the Republicans\nvirtually all of them -- who opposed extending unemployment insurance to millions of Americans who were thrown out of\nwork by the Republicans' corporate sponsors. It isn't too late for Democrats to contrast their support for the highly popular\naid to state and local governments that just saved the jobs of hundreds of thousands of teachers, firefighters, and police\nall over the country with Republicans' desire to throw them out onto the street. It isn't too late to make a voting issue out of\nthe bill the Republicans are stalling that would give small businesses a fighting chance in an economy stacked against\nthem, and to make clear that one party stands for small businesses, which create 75 percent of the new jobs in this\ncountry, and the other party stands for big businesses that outsource American jobs and offshore their profits to avoid\npaying their fair share of American taxes. It's not too late to pass a bill that would limit credit card interest rates to a\nreasonable percent above the rate at which credit is made available to credit card companies. It's not too late to pass the\nfirst badly need \"fix\" to the health care reform act to demonstrate to Americans that Democrats mean it when they say this\nwas just the first step, namely a law that stops insurance companies from increasing their premiums by 40 percent while\ncutting the size of their networks by 50-75 percent, which violates the principles of affordability and choice that were so\nessential to efforts to sell health care reform to the public. It's not too late to vow to change the rules of the Senate to\nprevent the use of the filibuster to give every special interest veto power over every important piece of legislation. It's not\ntoo late to introduce legislation that's been on hold in both the House and Senate to guarantee fair elections, so that the\nvoice of everyday Americans is heard over the voice of the special interests that finance political campaigns.\nOn every one of these issues, a strong populist message trounces anything the other side can say. But Democrats need\nto play offense. They need to take up-or-down votes on bill after bill, including those they expect the other side to block,\nknowing that every one of those votes has the leverage of a campaign ad behind it. They need to change the narrative\nfrom what sounds to the average American like a whiny and impotent one -- \"the Republicans won't let us do it\" -- to a\nnarrative of strength in numbers shared with their constituents. And they need to make every election a choice between\ntwo well-articulated approaches to governance -- and to offer their articulation of both sides' positions and values.\nThat leads to a final point. What Democrats have needed to offer the American people is a clear narrative about what and\nwho led our country to the mess in which we find ourselves today and a clear vision of what and who will lead us out. That\nnarrative would have laid a roadmap for our elected officials and voters alike, rather than making each legislative issue a\nseemingly discrete turn onto a dirt road. That narrative might have included -- and should include today -- some key\nelements: that if the economy is tumbling, it's the role of leadership and government to stop the free-fall; that if Wall Street\nis gambling with our financial security, our homes, and our jobs, true leaders do not sit back helplessly and wax eloquent\nabout the free market, they take away the dice; that if the private sector can't create jobs for people who want to work,\nthen we'll put Americans back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, and schools; that if Big Oil is preventing us from\ncompeting with China's wind and solar energy programs, then we'll eliminate the tax breaks that lead to dysfunctional\ninvestments in 19th century fuels and have a public-private partnership with companies that will create the clean, safe\nfuels of the 21st century and the millions of good American jobs that will follow.\nThat's what Democrats stand for. It's time they said it.\n\nDrew Westen, Ph.D., is Professor of Psychology and Psychiatry at Emory University, founder of Westen Strategies, and\nauthor of The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation.",

Israel said it will not give up any part of Jerusalem, including the eastern sector, which it captured in 1967. The Palestinians want to make east Jerusalem their future capital. The Israeli government has tried to suppress any activity by Prime Minister Fayyad's Palestinian Authority in east Jerusalem and has warned him against entering Jerusalem on November 2 to make the announcement about the renovations. Fayyad avoided confrontation and chose a West Bank school on the edge of Jerusalem. The West Bank government has spent more than $5 million on the renovations.",

    "text": "H: In case you missed this, by the FT international affairs editor, esp the last graph. Sid\nFinancial Times FT.com\nA poisoned process holds little hope\nBy David Gardner\nPublished: August 25 2010 22:46 | Last updated: August 25 2010 22:46\nAs the caravans of Middle East peace negotiators rumble into Washington next week for the umpteenth time, the\npervasive cynicism and sense of deja vu all over again is overwhelming - and with good reason.\nThe Middle East peace process long ago turned into a tortured charade of pure process while events on the ground - in\nparticular the relentless and strategic Israeli colonisation of occupied Palestinian land - pull in the opposite direction to\npeace. \"We have all been colluding in a gigantic confidence trick,\" is how one Arab minister puts it, \"and here we go\nagain.\"\nWhile many factors had combined to hand veto powers to rejectionists on both sides, the heart of the question remains\nthe continuing Israeli occupation. It is essential to remember that the biggest single increase of Jewish settlers on Arab\nland a 50 per cent rise - took place in 1992-96 under the governments of peace-makers Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon\nPeres at the high-water mark of the Oslo peace accords. Many Israelis will point to the perfidy of the late Yassir Arafat,\nwho wanted to talk peace but keep the option of armed resistance dangerously in play. But what killed Oslo was the\noccupation. The second intifada that erupted a decade ago was essentially the Oslo war.\nA decade on, the Israeli settlement enterprise has turned the occupied West Bank into a discontiguous scattering of\ncantons, walled in by a security barrier built on yet more annexed Arab land and cross-crossed by segregated Israeli roads\nlinking the settlements. Last month, B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group, published a study showing Israel has now\ntaken 42 per cent of the West Bank, with 300,000 settlers there and another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. The siege of\nGaza has turned that sliver of land into a vast, open-air prison.\nThe main feature of the present situation is the disconnect between the high politics of the utterly discredited peace\nprocess and these - in Israeli parlance - \"facts on the ground\".\nAt last month's White House summit, where Barack Obama and Benjamin Netanyahu massaged their long estrangement\ninto a political armistice, the US president praised the Israeli prime minister as a leader \"willing to take risks for peace\".\nBut there is no evidence for this whatsoever. True, in June last year, in response to Mr Obama's Cairo speech denying\nany legitimacy to Israel's settlements, Mr Netanyahu forced himself to utter the words \"Palestinian state\" - but he\nsurrounded them with barbed-wire caveats that voided them of meaning.\nIndeed, the words all sides use peace, resolution, security, and so on may be the same; but what each side means by\nthem is different.\nThe mainstream Palestinian leaders, President Mahmoud Abbas and Salam Fayyad, the prime minister, and the Quartet\nmade up of the US, the European Union, the UN and Russia, talk of a negotiated resolution. This means two states living\nin peace and security, and a Palestinian homeland on the 22 per cent of Mandate Palestine taken by Israel in the 1967\nArab-Israeli war. East Jerusalem would serve as the capital of the West Bank and Gaza, with marginal land swaps to\npreserve some Israeli settlements near Jerusalem. But what does Mr Netanyahu mean?\nHe has been most clear on what he does not mean. For a start, he has set his face against any concessions on\nJerusalem. He wants to keep most settlements except for the far-flung \"ideological\" ones and the 100-plus \"outposts\"\nestablished as pawns to be traded once the chess game began. His idea of a demilitarised Palestinian state is more like a\nsort of supra-municipal administration than a self-determined, independent government.\nWill he surprise us, on the hackneyed Nixon and China principle that holds it is politicians of the right who most easily\nclose difficult deals? There is little to suggest that.\nThe thinking of Mr Netanyahu, son of a celebrated promoter of Greater Israel, has always been profoundly irrederitist.\nWhile his nationalist Likud faces the constraints of being in coalition with an assortment of ultra-rightist and ultra-orthodox\nparties as well as Labour, that was plainly his choice; the centrist Kadima party was (and remains) an alternative. To be\nfair, Israel's electoral system - with a low threshold for entry into the Knesset that makes multi-party coalitions inevitable\nmeans lobbies such as the settlers can take the national interest hostage. But Mr Netanyahu magnifies this by his choice\nof partners and by diligently firing up the ultra-hawks in the pro-Israel lobby in the US.\nAs risks he has taken for peace, Exhibit A is the much-hyped moratorium on settlement-building, which expires next\nmonth and has, in any case, been speciously interpreted. While the bulldozers to build settlements have been idling,\nmoreover, the bulldozers demolishing Palestinian homes have been roaring: the rate of demolition in and around\nJerusalem has doubled this year, while the army has just razed the village of al-Farisiye in the Jordan Valley, in line with\nMr Netanyahu's strategically obsolete obsession with keeping the valley as Israel's eastern border.\nAs diplomacy struggles to keep alive the viability of a two-state solution, three rival systems of control have crystallised in\nthe occupied territories that would make up a future Palestinian homeland: the settlements; the crimped Palestinian\nAuthority of Mr Abbas and Mr Fayyad; and then Hamas, which Israel and its Arab and western allies have tried and failed\nto marginalise. Time is short for a negotiated outcome; it may even have run out.\nThe outlines of a deal are clear, in the (Bill) Clinton parameters of 2000 and Arab Peace Initiative of 2002, endorsed by 22\nArab and 57 Muslim countries (as well as Hamas, as part of the 2007 Mecca accord). There has to be an end to the\noccupation, and the US and Quartet cannot just allude to this; they must demand it.\nThe writer is international affairs editor\n\"FT\" and \"Financial Times\" are trademarks of the Financial Times.

U.S. counterterrorism officials said they believe that senior al-Qaida leaders, including\nbin Laden, were involved in the plan to strike several European cities in a coordinated assault. If bin Laden had a direct\nhand in the planning, it would be the most active role he has played in a terror plot since the 9/11 attacks, according to\nU.S. officials and analysts.\nCounterterrorism officials said that they are now working under the assumption that bin Laden played a role in the\nplotting, but they would not detail what indications they've seen that led them in that direction.\nStill, some also believe that bin Laden's orders may have been delivered by one of his top commanders, since the al-\nQaida leader is known to avoid close contact with anyone except his closet confidants.\nWhile bin Laden's name is still a powerful reminder of the World Trade Center's twin towers and the Pentagon\nengulfed in flames, U.S. officials have for months asserted both in private and in hearings on Capitol Hill that his core al-\nQaida group is weakened, struggling to raise money and attract recruits.\n\"Clearly there is a great deal of pressure on al-Qaida to do something to show that it is still alive and kicking,\" said\nRichard Barrett, the head of a U.N. group that monitors the threat posed by al-Qaida and the Taliban. \"They need to\nshow they're strong, they're a force multiplier, that they've still got some beef, that they've got operators abroad, that\nthey can do things.\"\nBarrett said al-Qaida's Pakistan-based network has not launched a successful attack since the London subway\nbombing in 2005. \"In order to attract the younger new recruits, I think they have to do a bit better than that,\" he said.\nThe multi-pronged scope of the emerging terror plan_ which aimed to launch coordinated shooting rampages or\nattacks in Britain, France and Germany_ is an al-Qaida hallmark.\nU.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, declined to reveal what evidence\nthey have that bin Laden took a more prominent role in this plan. And one U.S. intelligence official cautioned that the\ndetails of how the plan was directed or coordinated by the group's core leaders is not yet clear.\nThe involvement of bin Laden and his devoted leaders, believed to be in hiding in Pakistan, underscores continuing\nU.S. concerns about that country's role as a safe haven for al-Qaida and other Islamic extremists.\nAnd it reflects al-Qaida's persistent effort _ through video and online messages _ to inspire its followers to wage\nattacks against the West. The threat to Europe was highlighted when bin Laden issued a call to arms in March 2008 after\na Danish newspaper printed controversial cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.\nHe warned Europeans in an audio message that there would be a \"severe\" reaction to come.\nRep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said that bin Laden may\nsimply be trying to re-exert himself. And his role in the European plot could suggest a lack of confidence by al-Qaida\ncentral in the ability of other affiliated groups in Yemen or Africa to carry out a successful attack on their own, Hoekstra\nsaid.\nOver the past year, several terror attacks in the U.S. have either failed or been foiled, including the botched attempts\nto bring down a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day and to set off a bomb in New York's Time Square.\n\"They've let other people take the lead on attacking the West,\" said Hoekstra, adding that bin Laden may now be\nthinking, \"these guys can't do it, we've got to become more involved again.\"\nBin Laden's presumed role in the European plot was first reported by NPR.\nOne senior U.S. official, meanwhile, discounted any involvement in the Europe terror plot by al-Qaida's North African\naffiliate. While al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb is dangerous in its region and may want to export its terror operations to\nEurope, there are no indications that it is able to do that at this time, said the official.\nA Pakistani intelligence official said Thursday that eight Germans and two British brothers are at the heart of the\nEuropean terror plot, which is still in its early stages. One of the Britons was killed in a recent CIA missile strike, he said.\nPakistan, Britain and Germany are tracking the suspects and intercepting their phone calls, the official told The\nAssociated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information to the media.\nU.S. officials have pressed Pakistan to increase its efforts to root out the militants hiding in the mountainous border\nregion.\nThe U.S. has dramatically stepped up its missile attacks in North Waziristan, and is believed to have launched at least\n21 this month. The covert campaign is largely carried out by CIA drones and has led to the deaths of a number of top\nmilitant leaders.\nPakistan has complained vocally about the program but is believed to provide intelligence assistance for at least some\nof the strikes.",

Including with regard to any of the matters flagged below. We do not know when that judicial process will be completed, although the next hearing is scheduled for October.

It's about 5 pages; I really think it is worth a read. Finally, on changing the frame to look forward, I strongly recommend that you spend 8 minutes to look at a video produced by a Rand study called The Arc, which proposes a high-speed road/rail project connecting the key cities in the West Bank and Gaza. It is a powerful, powerful vision of what could be, one that will play right into Bibi's emphasis on economic growth. For my money, it would be worth a private 8 minutes screening.

    "text": "1. The Republican Party, despite everything, remains deeply unpopular. (See the second Ohio poll below.) 2. The Republicans have made the election a referendum on Obama and the Democrats, succeeding beyond their wildest dreams. (See the first poll below on Obama-Bush matchup and question 12 in second poll on Ohio voters' recall on who they voted for in 2008, giving McCain a three point margin.) 3. The Republicans have managed to hide their own negatives through the negative campaign against Obama. 4. The campaign is not being conducted as a contest. The Republicans have succeeded in making it only about approval of Obama. 5. The GOP is hiding John Boehner, who is unpopular in his home state of Ohio, where he's best known. To the extent he is known, he is disliked. 6. The Republicans are pretending they offer something new and not really the same old Republicans, to the extent they make any sort of offer. 7. The Tea Party is deliberately trying to hide its extremism behind a mask of novelty and now religious rhetoric. (The right wing strategy has been spelled out in detail to a friend of mine, 8. So far, there is no Democratic campaign to focus on the Republicans and, therefore, no contest. Republicans are not being exposed for their increasing dependence on extremists. They are not being pressed for their refusal to denounce extremism. Nor is the Tea Party being revealed as an extremist takeover movement. Nor is the Republicans' motive for smearing Obama being identified as a cynical strategy to put Boehner in power. 9. Whatever issue ginned up by Republicans—from illegal immigration to the \"ground zero mosque\"—is not about the issue itself. Everything, but everything, is about making John Boehner, that old scandal ridden hack Republican, the Speaker. No matter what the Republicans say, the ultimate issue is the Boehner power-grab.",

His prediction: \"a wave of Biblical proportions\" in November. the House is gone; he sees a new bloc of up to 10 true conservative senators, joining Coburn and DeMint, and creating a virtual third party in Senate holding balance of power. He says their polling suggests Tea Party candidates well ahead in Ky., Colo., senate races (NYT disputes that today), and Nevada still a tossup..I went to the Glenn Back rally, and largely agreed with my assessment that its purpose in part was to inoculate the movement against public concern over extremism and racism leading up to election. (Thus theme of Faith, Hope, Charity.) Americans for Prosperity (Koch group) made sure there were no signs, etc. No love lost for post-1996 Republican hacks, among whom he numbered Gingrich, DeLay, Hastert -- and Rove who is on the outs with his people. Oversight committees will take lead in House after GOP victory, with a particular focus on Holder and Justice Dept. and KSM decision. Purpose will be to keep Democrats on defensive for whole 2 years leading up to 2012 election. (Obama, you recall, nixed investigations of Bush administration because he wanted to unite the country.) Would there be an investigation of Obama citizenship?? couldnt say b ecause he is now totally focused on the election, not what comes after. My take: Of course House will vote to repeal health care reform (despite no chance of senate passage); funding dozens of EPA initiatives in Appropriations Committee, and there will be stand-alone vote to block EPA from implementing carbon rûles (even though EPA is only acting as a result of a Supreme Court decision); and budget legislation that adopts part of the Ryan plan (tho not privatization of SS.)..",

The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him as\n'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals.\" In \"Ankara WikiLeaks\nEpicenter,\" mainstream Hurriyet's front page headline report mirrors most Turkish media reports in saying that the\ndocuments show that the US Embassy in Ankara views Turkey \"as a country with divisions in leadership\" and that \"Turkey\ncannot be trusted because it was not likely to join the EU and was heading to an Islamist future.\" Hurriyet spotlights reports\nthat purportedly say Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan had \"incompetent\" advisors and was pursuing a secret, Islamist agenda\nand that describe him as \"stubborn, workaholic and perfectionist,\" but \"not a tyrant.\" Hurriyet concludes that reports indicated\nthat that the US views Turkish Foreign Minister Davutoglu as an \"exceptionally dangerous\" figure and that \"America had\nbeen alarmed by his aspirations to reassert the influence the Ottoman Empire used to exert on the region.\" In \"9/11 of\nDiplomacy: WikiLeaks Releases 'Secret State Documents,\" Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that Ankara believes [the high\nnumber of cables from the US Embassy in Ankara] proves Turkey's importance and its diplomatic effectiveness.\" In \"The\nWikiLeaks Bomb,\" pro-government, Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak reports the WikiLeaks releases contain \"shocking details\"\nsuch as the chief of Mossad, Meir Dagan, telling an American official Islam was on the rise in Turkey, and \"asking for how\nlong the military, the defender of the secular identity, would remain silent.\" Other media cover the story as follows:\nIn its two-page spread, Zaman chronicles details of a FM Davutoglu -A/S Gordon meeting from November 12, 2009 in\nwhich the US side asks Turkey to take a tougher position against Iran if Tehran disregards international pressure, as well\nas a February 18, 2010 meeting between U/S of State William Burns and Turkish Foreign Ministry U/S Feridun Sinirlioglu\non Iraq.\nIn \"Hell Breaks Loose,\" mainstream Vatan focuses on the detailed US reports about Prime Minister Erdogan and AK\nParty. The paper notes on its centerfold piece that Ergenekon was closely watched by the US and that US officials were\nholding talks with Turkish generals. Both the Turkish government and the Turkish army were under close US\nsurveillance, notes Vatan.\nPro-government Sabah in \"Turkey Mark in WikiLeaks Documents,\" says the State Department has been waiting for the\nWikileaks release with \"curiosity and fear.\" Iran, Azerbaijan and the EU stand on the forefront in documents related to\nTurkey, says the paper.\nLeftist Taraf in its front page banner headline, \"They Monitored Even Erdogan's Son-in-Law,\" notes \"in the documents,\nbusiness connections of PM Erdogan's son-in-law were closely watched by the US. It's claimed that Erdogan rules\nTurkey with a group of incapable plotters.\"\nMainstream Aksam in \"9/11 of Diplomacy,\" mentions American diplomats find Davutoglu very dangerous and add that\n\"Turkey, with its axis shifting to East, is heading to an Islamist state.\"\nLiberal Radikal and most media including the CNN-Turk headline \"9/11 of Diplomacy.\" Radikal highlights \"there was a\nstruggle to prevent Wikileaks from releasing the secret documents but that \"the documents that could put the relations\nwith the US in trouble have been released anyway.\"\nIn \"Hell Breaks Loose,\" mainstream Vatan focuses on the detailed US reports about Prime Minister Erdogan and AK\nParty. The paper notes on its centerfold piece that Ergenekon was closely watched by the US and that US officials were\nholding talks with Turkish generals. Both the Turkish government and the Turkish army were under close US\nsurveillance, notes Vatan.\nCommentary In Full: \"WikiLeaks Crypto will Cause Crisis in Washington” (Milliyet)\nAsli Aydintasbas in Milliyet. \"Three elements might cause damage between Ankara and Washington in the WikiLeaks\nrevelations related to Turkey. First comes the claim that Turkey has helped al-Qaeda. A high level official believes this\nclaim will not be convincing, because Ankara has proven itself in fighting against al-Qaeda. We recently see a flurry of\nnews relating Turkey to al-Qaeda. All Turkish officials I have spoken with believe that such reports had been a campaign\nagainst Turkey which was launched right after the Mavi Marmara crisis. The second claim is the US is helping the\nPKK. If the WikiLeaks documents reveal a concrete tie between the US and the PKK, it will rock the two countries, further\ndamaging the image of the US in Turkey. From time to time, the US has allowed Turkey to launch military operations into\nnorthern Iraq, but actually never really fought against the PKK. As a high level official put it, the US never supported the\nPKK but it also did not let the organization be destroyed, and kept it as an element of balance. The sources I have talked\nto said the leaks could contain information about the contacts of American officers or intelligence members with the PKK\non security or other issues. Another possibility is contacts between Americans and the PKK's Iran wing, PJAK, but it's a\nremote possibility that this issue would be mentioned in diplomatic cables rather than intelligence reports. The third claim\nis the expressions used in the US State Department cables to define Turkish leaders. Over the past year, the AK Party\ngovernment had a volatile relationship with the Obama Administration. The documents show that Americans do not see\nthe government in Ankara as a real ally, and that they have concerns. Unlike the style used in bilateral meetings, a much\ntougher language is used backstage. The fact that the Turkish foreign minister knows his interlocutors characterize him as\n'dangerous' at a time he's in Washington will stiffen the distrustfulness between the two capitals.\"\nThis email is UNCLASSIFIED.\nDeborah L.

In his new work he is proposing a grand strategy of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator version. What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller military due to budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to apply this proposal to Afghanistan.\"An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national security objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon (\"off-shore\") military power and in-region (\"on-shore\") economic and political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment of large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continue and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly deployable ground forces in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure America's interests in combating terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.\"AM",

We also welcome the United States' Strategy for Meeting the Millennium Development Goals, \"Celebrate,\nInnovate and Sustain: Toward 2015 and Beyond.\" While we have made progress on some goals, we still have much to do\nif we are going to meet these global commitments by 2015.\n\nAttached or linked below are CARE's recommendations for meeting the Millennium Development Goals and for\nstrengthening the US' MDG strategy. Our recommendations include approaches and strategies proven to deliver results\nspecifically on MDGs 1, 3, 5 and 7. CARE's reflections on the MDGs are drawn from more than 60 years of experience\nworking with the poorest communities in more than 70 countries around the world. Women are at the heart of CARE's\nefforts because experience shows that a woman's achievements yield dramatic benefits for her entire family and the larger\ncommunity. Promoting gender equality and women's empowerment is central to poverty reduction and the achievement\nof all MDGs.\n\nThe MDG Summit provides a critical opportunity to take bold and decisive action. CARE believes that the following guiding\nprinciples must be reflected in the outcome of the MDG Summit, in the US' MDG strategy, as well as in the US' and the\ninternational community's implementation efforts:\n• An emphasis on meeting the needs of people in extreme poverty and the most vulnerable populations;\n• Promotion of gender equality, gender responsiveness, and the empowerment of women;\n• Adherence to broad-based country ownership, including broad stakeholder engagement with local communities,\nwomen's groups, and other vulnerable populations, in a whole-of-society approach to development;\n• Recognition of the linkages among the eight MDGs; and\n• A commitment to transparency, mutual accountability, and mechanisms to track results.\nAny recommitment to the MDGs must be coupled with commitments to mobilize the necessary resources that will reach\nthe people who need them most. In the context of the US' development strategy, CARE also believes that USAID must be\nempowered as the premier US development agency to lead these efforts, and we call on the Administration and Congress\nto work together to reform and modernize US foreign assistance policies, efforts and strategies.\n\nCARE urges bold efforts to recommit to the MDGs and ensure progress toward their achievement. The MDG Summit can\nbe the turning point in collective efforts to achieve the MDGs by 2015. It is critical that the global community unite around\na shared action-oriented strategy for meeting - and exceeding - these goals and begin to lay the groundwork for post-\n2015.\n\nCARE stands ready to support your efforts and looks forward to continuing valuable collaboration with the US government\nand other leaders to tackle poverty worldwide.

These stats come from a NYT Op-Ed piece:\n•Over 20% of California's debt issuance during 2009 and over 30% of its debt issuance in 2010 to date has beensubsidized by the federal government in a program known as Build America Bonds. Under the program, the U.S.Treasury covers 35% of the interest paid by the bonds. Arguably, without this program the interest cost of bondsfor some states would have reached prohibitive levels.\n•\"California is not alone: Over 30% of Illinois's debt and over 40% of Nevada's debt issued since 2009 has alsobeen subsidized with these bonds. These states might have already reached some type of tipping point had thefederal program not been in place.\"\n•\"Today, more than 28% of state funding comes from federal government transfers, the highest contribution onrecord. These transfers have made states dependent on federal assistance. New York, for example, spent inexcess of 250% of its tax receipts over the last decade. The largest 15 states by GDP spent on average over 220%of their tax receipts. Clearly, states have been spending at unsustainable levels without facing immediateconsequences due to federal transfer payments and other temporary factors.\"Bob",

(Mark Wilson / Getty Images) The secretary of State delivered\nthe best speech of the Obama administration this morning. Tunku Varadarajan on\nher \"new American moment\"-and why she's better than her boss.\nBehold the Hillary Doctrine. And heap abundant gratitude-and rose petals if you\nhave them on hand-on the firm, unfussy, deeply reassuring woman who has just\noffered it up to the world.\nIn the 20 months since this administration began administering (a verb I use\nonly in the loosest sense), the speech\n<http://www.cspan.org/Watch/Media/2010/09/08/HP/R/37857/Sec+Clinton+discusses+Advancing+A\nmerican+Interests+on+a+Global+Scale.aspx>\nWednesday morning by Hillary Clinton, delivered at the Council on Foreign\nRelations <http://www.cfr.org/>\nwas the first time we have been given an\nunreserved lift of the heart by any of its members. It was, by far, the best\nspeech of this administration. Whereas her president has frequently wrung his\nelegant hands, doing the rounds of the world to reassure foreign leaders that\nAmerica is a cuddly bunny at heart, the secretary of State declared Wednesday\nthat we are all living “a new American moment-a moment when our global\nleadership is essential.\" There was no bowing from her to potentates in robes;\nthere was, instead, a promise that “we will do everything we can to exercise the\ntraditions of American leadership at home and abroad.\"\nWhat is so piquant here is not the fact that Hillary understands that Obama is\npresident. It is the growing sense that Hillary would have made a much, much\nbetter president than Obama.\nTry this for size: \"The United States can, must and will lead in the new\ncentury.\" In order to do that, Clinton promised \"a new global architecture,\"\n\"built to last and withstand stress.\" And in a muscular departure from the way\nin which this administration for fear of seeming Bush-like-has been shrinking\nfrom the unembarrassed propagation of American values, she uttered these\nplainspoken, unadorned words: \"Democracy needs defending.\"\nHuman rights, too, came in for a robust airing: China was scolded, and exhorted\nto follow \"the rules of the road\" in its aspiration to be a great power; as was\nRussia, for its invasion of Georgia. The message: We may live in a multipolar\nworld, but we have higher standards by far than those who would style themselves\nas our equals.\nClinton used phrases like \"American might,\" words that we are more accustomed to\nhearing from Republicans-words that we've come to believe that many Democrats\ncan't bear to voice. How refreshing, therefore, that she should reach into a\nvocabulary of pride that most American citizens would applaud.\nHillary Clinton invoked the name of Dean Acheson\n<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean Acheson>\nin her reference to the need for \"good, old-fashioned diplomacy,\" and there\ncertainly was an air of the Achesonian, of the statesman, about her speech.\nGood, old-fashioned diplomacy, it should be noted, is in contrast to Obama's\napparent preference for seeing America as a nation like any other, only a bit\nbigger, richer, and better-armed. Clinton's \"old-fashioned\" diplomacy is based,\nby contrast, on the unquestionable premise that America is the world's leader.\nNot primus inter pares; just primus.\nIn her speech, Clinton referred to the sources of “American might.\" The first,\nof course, is \"economic power.\" But it is her hailing of the second-America's\n\"moral authority\"-that was so invigorating.\nIt was Acheson who said: \"The most important aspect of the relationship between\nthe president and the secretary of state is that they both understand who is\npresident.\" What is so piquant here, in this administration, is not the fact,\nplain to behold, that Hillary understands that Obama is president.

    "text": "The way you are coming across couldn't be better. Hillary Clinton sends strong message to world\n\nSF Chronicle Editorial Friday, September 10, 2010\n\nHillary Clinton's blend of diligence, caution and toughness didn't always serve her well as a presidential candidate. But these attributes make her a powerful secretary of state, the unsung hero for a White House team trying to mend global fences without looking weak.\n\nIn a speech this week, Clinton laid down the law for an audience wondering where Obama is headed on foreign policy. Would she favor hand-holding with rivals such as China and Russia, a sign that Washington was ducking trouble in the name of consensus building?\n\nNot at all, suggested Clinton in a lengthy speech to the Council of Foreign Relations. In her diplomatic travels, she found a hunger for U.S. leadership, and she wants everyone to know it. \"The U.S. can, must and will lead in this century,\" she said. The \"complexities of this world\" mean there's an opening for \"a new American moment, a moment when our global leadership is essential.\"\n\nHer message of strength and obligation may make Obama truehearts swoon. Clinton's thoughts also come at the start of an election season when President Obama will be knocked for failures overseas along with the economy.\n\nBut it's also vintage Clinton. From her days on the Senate's Armed Services Committee, she was always a proponent of military muscle and a tough regard for American foes. She and Defense Secretary Robert Gates, another hawkish voice, are running the Obama foreign policy store.\n\nDiplomatic speeches, even one as striking as Clinton's, are a dime a dozen. Clinton's challenge will be delivering on any of the disputes facing her. There's a long line: a truculent North Korea, new Mideast talks, a rising China, a defiant Iran, and a half dozen lesser conflicts ranging from African civil wars to drug gangs in Mexico.\nThere is newness and complication in her outlook, she indicated. Her job is essentially a permanent road trip, meaning success will hinge on \"shoe-leather diplomacy,\" the steady attention that the wonky, workaholic Clinton believes is needed for any breakthrough. The Israeli-Palestinian talks, which begin again next week with her at the center, are a chance for her patience and force to pay off. On Iran, she believes that ever-tightening sanctions accepted by a larger group of nations will eventually pay off.\nHer remarks come with other conditions. A soaring national debt and recession worries preoccupy the White House. The nation's global reach is bounded by financial limits. Her robust views about American might could easily fade next to more pressing domestic worries. Also, no matter how thoughtful or acute her remarks, there will always be detractors who think she's angling for the top job in the White House.\nClinton's doctrine adds urgency in settling affairs on a crowded world stage. Washington has a special duty to lead, a role that much of the world appreciates. It's time to accept that role, not shy away from it because of political risk or recent history.\n--\nSusan P Kennedy",

    "subject": "Some paragraphs on the Tea Party",
    "text": "First, of course your instinct is right to attempt to save the situation. I think, however, it is fraught. Being right easily might be worse than being wrong. (Doing absolutely nothing, meanwhile, would bear no cost, just to note the benefits of irresponsibility.) So, how any advice can be proposed without potential pitfalls is a mystery to me. It may be that Bill delivers the message in public, on the stump. This message, on extremism and the GOP, ought to be given soon, on Labor Day or immediately thereafter. Urgently, the momentum of the far right needs to be blunted; it must be redefined; the political discussion must be shaped and shifted; and the GOP must be put on the defensive and begin to pay the price.\nI will send you another memo soon, with other messages, themes and strategies.\nHere, for better or worse, is some language on extremism and the Republican Party:\nThe Republican Party today is a captive party. It is captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme right. It is captive to its out-of-power desperation for political power—willing to do and say anything to grab it—willing to use extremists to help climb back to power—willing to give the extremists power. No one is speaking up for responsible conservatism within the Republican Party. Who will play the role of William F. Buckley, Jr.? Or Richard Nixon? Or Ronald Reagan? Or Barry Goldwater? They all drew lines to separate the party from the extremists. Now who has the courage to condemn the outrageous bigotry and slander against the President? Have they at long last no sense of decency?\nIf the Republicans don't have the nerve to speak up for their own best heritage, then someone has to do it. The Republican Party is in a state of political disorder. Into the midst of its chaos a Trojan Horse has been thrust in the form of a self-proclaimed Tea Party as though the extremists behind it have something to do with the American Revolution and are not a stealth takeover operation of a confused political party funded by the same people who paid for the extremist movements against President Eisenhower and President Kennedy.\nThere is a straight line between extremists then and extremists now. One of those lines is a money line. Follow the money. Another continuity is the far right John Birch Society that is praised today by Glenn Beck. Listen closely. Yet another of those lines are the same accusations of disloyalty. Ike was a Communist. John F. Kennedy was a Communist. They said President Nixon was a tool of international Communism. And when the Cold War was ending they said Ronald Reagan was \"a useful idiot of the Kremlin.\" Now they are saying that President Obama is a socialist and at the same time a fascist. They say he's a racist and a secret Muslim. They claim the President of the United States is not an American. It's so crazy it sounds like a science fiction novel, but we've heard it all before. The extremists have not changed. From Ike to JFK, from Nixon to Reagan, and now Obama, it's the same old horsestuff.\nFor anyone with common sense it might seem like one big joke, a big put-on, or maybe just a big con job. But it's dangerous. It's toxic. Why? In the name of the founding fathers, the Constitution and the flag, in the name of taking back our country and restoring it, they would transform our democracy into something we wouldn't recognize. The extremists of the far right want to replace the greatest experiment in constitutional democracy with their own far-out ideology—trashing everything from religious liberty to protections from a dog-eat-dog boom and bust economy. Public education, a safe environment, national highways, safe transportation, Social Security, Medicare, health care for all, even the Federal Reserve created to curb economic chaos—they want to get rid of all of it. If you think that if they had their way they wouldn't kick the country into an economic abyss, produce another Great Depression, then I've got a reality show in Alaska for you. And that's not all that's in their sweeping blueprint for power.\nThe Republican Party is being purged of moderates, responsible conservatives, anyone who has a thought they don't like. It's divide and conquer. Divide the Republican Party. Divide the nation. Region against region, South against North, West against East, rural America against cities, state governments against the federal government, religion against religion, and soon, before you know it, it won't look or feel like America. Out of loud declarations of love of country, they will break this country apart.\nHow far do the extremists want to go? The demonizing of enemies and even religions is a means to an end. That end is political power. Political power for themselves, for their political leaders—characters who are hardly outsiders but dusty denizens roaming the corridors of power for. decades. They want political power—political power for favors, exemptions and loopholes for the Daddy Warbucks and Scrooge McDucks funding them. Political power for special interests. Political power against the national interest. Political power against the common good. Political power against the good society.\nPresident Obama is their target because the people have put him in his office and he stands in the way of the extremists. They are against him precisely because he's making progress. And progress is not what they want. They want power for themselves. So they will say anything to tear down the President. But they are at war with more than President Obama. They are at war with President Andrew Jackson. That's how far back they want to go. They want to go back the 1830s. They want to go back to before the Civil War, \"lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification,\" to quote Martin Luther King, Jr. in his famous \"I have a dream\" speech. They want to interpose their rule and their power above that of majority rule and\ndemocratic government—and nullify the law of the land in the name of their strange doctrines. So when I say that this is dangerous and toxic, we've been there before. Fanatics have divided America in the past. We know, as another president said, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\"\nAnd when you see them demonizing the President, Ike, JFK, Obama, take your pick—when you see them accusing members of the Republican Party of treason––when you hear them compare the American experiment in democracy to Hitler's Nazi state or Stalin's Communist totalitarianism—when you hear them talk of \"liberty\" and they mean taking away Social Security from people who worked their whole lives to earn it––when you hear them talk of \"freedom\" when they want to bring back good old fashioned discrimination––when you hear them talk of \"the Constitution\" when they want to get rid of the letter and spirit of the government designed by the framers of the Constitution––when you hear them talk of \"democracy\" when they want to get rid of direct election of senators––when you hear them talk about \"restoration\" when they want to gut public education and Medicare and basic economic and environmental protections––trashing the work and progress of generations––then you know that behind the patriotic words lies a truly radical agenda.\nIt was Dwight Eisenhower who warned: \"Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.\"\nIt was John F. Kennedy who said: \"In the most critical periods of our nation's history, there have always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat. Financial crises could be explained by the presence of too many immigrants or too few greenbacks... So let us not heed these counsels of fear and suspicion... Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of confidence rather than crusades of suspicion. Let us prove we think our country great by striving to make it greater.\"\nOutspoken conservatives like William F. Buckley drew the line and stood up for principle against the extremists, calling them \"idiotic\" and \"paranoid.\" Barry Goldwater, at the end of his life, said, \"Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt the Republican Party much more than the Democrats have.\"\nThen, this sort of thing, instilling a tone of confidence: Come together, right now...for a new era of progress...rebuilding America...the work of a new generation...building on the progress of generations...facing any challenge...resolving that we can and will overcome any obstacle...keeping the faith, not succumbing to temptations of fear and suspicion...not retreating but advancing...not dividing the American people for short-term politics but bringing the American people together for long-term progress...combining our will, our work, our intelligence, creativity, enterprise, and energy to make a new world of freedom for ourselves and our children...",

    "text": "September 11, 2010\nG.O.P. Leader Is Tightly Bound to Lobbyists\nBy ERIC LIPTON\nWASHINGTON - House Democrats were preparing late last year for the first floor vote on the financial regulatory\noverhaul when Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio and other Republican leaders summoned more than 100 industry\nlobbyists to Capitol Hill for a private strategy session.\nThe bill's passage in the House already seemed inevitable. But Mr. Boehner and his deputies told the Wall Street\nlobbyists and trade association leaders that by teaming up, they could still perhaps block its final passage or at least water\nit down.\n\"We need you to get out there and speak up against this,\" Mr. Boehner said that December afternoon, according to three\npeople familiar with his remarks, while also warning against cutting side deals with Democrats.\nThat sort of alliance - they won a few skirmishes, though they lost the war on the regulatory bill - is business as usual\nfor Mr. Boehner, the House minority leader and would-be speaker if Republicans win the House in November. He\nmaintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation's biggest\nbusinesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R. J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.\nThey have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns over the years, provided him rides on their\ncorporate jets, socialized with him at luxury golf resorts and waterfront bashes and are now leading fund-raising efforts for\nhis Boehner for Speaker campaign, which is soliciting checks of up to $37,800 each, the maximum allowed.\nSome of the lobbyists readily acknowledge routinely seeking his office's help - calling the congressman and his aides as\noften as several times a week to advance their agenda in Washington. And in many cases, Mr. Boehner has helped\nthem out.\nAs Democrats increasingly try to cast the Ohio congressman as the face of the Republican Party - President Obama\nmentioned his name eight times in a speech last week - and as Mr. Boehner becomes more visible, his ties to lobbyists,\ncultivated since he arrived here in 1991, are coming under attack.\nThe woman he hopes to replace, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, derided him on Friday as having met \"countless times with\nspecial-interest lobbyists in an effort to stop tough legislation\" that would regulate corporations and protect consumers.\nAnd the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, through a spokeswoman, charged that he \"epitomizes the\nsmoked-filled, backroom, special-interest deal making that turns off voters about Washington.\"\nMr. Boehner, who declined to be interviewed for this article, and his lobbyist allies ridicule such criticism as politically\nmotivated by desperate Democrats. His actions, they say, simply reflect the pro-business, antiregulatory philosophy that\nhe has espoused for more than three decades, dating back to when Mr. Boehner, the son of a tavern owner, ran a small\nplastics company in Ohio. And fielding requests from lobbyists is nothing unusual, he says.\n\"I get lobbied every day by somebody,\" he said last month after a speech in Cleveland. \"It could be by my wife. It could be\nthe bellman. It goes on all day, everyday, everyplace.\"\nMr. Boehner - a 60-year-old, perpetually tanned, sharply tailored, chain-smoking golfer is not as fiery as Newt\nGingrich or as unrelenting an arm-twister as Tom DeLay, two of his Republican predecessors in top House posts. It is his\nreputation as a \"Chamber of Commerce\" Republican and his fund-raising skills - he has raised $36 million for\nRepublican causes during this election cycle, more than almost anyone else in his party - that explain, in part, his rise.\nIf elected as his party's leader in the House, Mr. Boehner will certainly lean on his industry allies for help as he builds\ncoalitions necessary to push legislation through Congress, his office acknowledges. His friends say there is nothing wrong\nwith that.\n\"Does he have a lot of relationships in this city? Yes, absolutely,\" said Mark Isakowitz, a friend whose Republican firm\nrepresents more than three dozen financial, telecommunications, energy and consumer products companies as diverse\nas Coca-Cola and Zurich Financial Services. \"But I think all the good lawmakers do.\"\nMr. Boehner won some of his first national headlines back in 1996 after he was caught handing out checks from tobacco\nlobbyists to fellow Republicans on the House floor. Then the fourth-ranking House Republican, Mr. Boehner said he had\nbroken no rules and was simply assisting his lobbyist friends, who were contributing to other Republicans' campaigns.\nHis business-friendly reputation was enhanced through the weekly powwows he organized on Capitol Hill nicknamed the\nThursday Group, a gathering of conservative leaders and business lobbyists whom he relied on to help push the party's\nlegislative agenda. The Thursday gathering was disbanded after a Republican power struggle that cost him his leadership\nposition.\nBut he continued to routinely meet with business leaders, particularly in his role as chairman of the Education and the\nWorkforce Committee, and returned to power as House G.O.P. leader in 2006. Several of the onetime Thursday regulars,\nalong with some newcomers, are among the close-knit group that routinely call on Mr. Boehner's office for client matters,\nwrite checks to his campaign and socialize with him.\nThat tight circle includes Mr. Isakowitz; Bruce Gates, a lobbyist for the cigarette maker Altria; Nicholas E. Calio, a\nCitigroup lobbyist; and two former aides, Marc Lampkin and Sam Geduldig, both now financial services lobbyists.\nThe tobacco industry is particularly well represented, with both Mr. Gates and John Fish, a lobbyist for R. J. Reynolds,\nmaker of Camel cigarettes, in the group. People affiliated with those companies have contributed at least $340,000 to Mr.\nBoehner's political campaigns, with Mr. Gates being the top individual donor among the thousands during Mr. Boehner's\npolitical career, according to a tally by the Center for Public Integrity.\nWhile many lawmakers in each party have networks of donors, lobbyists and former aides who now represent corporate\ninterests, Mr. Boehner's ties seem especially deep. His clique even has a nickname on Capitol Hill, Boehner Land. The\nmembers of this inner circle said their association with Mr. Boehner translates into open access to him and his staff.\n\"He likes to bring similarly minded people together to try to advance legislation or oppose it,\" said Drew Maloney, a\nlobbyist at Ogilvy Government Relations. \"That is how you get things done.\"\nOne lobbyist in the club - after lauding each staff member in Mr. Boehner's office that he routinely calls to ask for help\nticked off the list of recent issues for which he had won the lawmaker's backing: combating fee increases for the oil\nindustry, fighting a proposed cap on debit card fees, protecting tax breaks for hedge fund executives and opposing a cap\non greenhouse gas emissions.\nStill, with Mr. Boehner and his party in the minority, they often lost the fights.\nBut despite the recent string of defeats on the House floor, Mr. Boehner has benefited from his alliance with lobbyists.\nFrom 2000 to 2007, Mr. Boehner flew at least 45 times, often with his wife, Debbie, on corporate jets provided by\ncompanies including R. J. Reynolds. (As required, Mr. Boehner reimbursed part of the costs.)\nIn addition, over the last decade, he has taken 41 other trips paid for by corporate sponsors or industry groups, often to\npopular golf spots. Those trips make him one of the top House beneficiaries of such travel, which has recently been\ncurbed as a result of changes in ethics rules in Washington.\nMr. Boehner continues to travel to popular golf destinations on a corporate-subsidized tab, although now it is paid for\nthrough his political action committee, the Freedom Project. In the last 18 months, it has spent at least $67,000 at the Ritz\nCarlton Naples in Florida, at least $20,000 at the Robert Trent Jones Golf Club in Gainesville, Va., and at least $29,000 at\nthe Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio, federal records show, for fund-raising events.\nIn June, with the prospects for a Republican takeover of the House rising, Mr. Boehner moved to accelerate his fund-\nraising effort, starting what he called the Boehner for Speaker campaign. The idea was to use his high profile to draw\nlarge donations that would be mostly allocated to help elect other House Republicans.\nHe turned again to the same group of lobbyists, former aides and friends during a July meeting at the headquarters of the\nRepublican National Committee.\n\"The wave is there, there is a rebellion in the country, and we have good candidates,\" Mr. Boehner told his supporters,\none of the lobbyists present at the meeting recalled. \"But I don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity because\nwe have not raised enough money. They might be able to stop us with a wall of money.\"\nMr. Calio of Citigroup was among the first to write a large check. So far, a party spokesman said, the campaign has raised\nnearly $2 million. Mr. Boehner has helped raise millions more in the last six weeks for Republican House candidates\nacross the country and the party, appearing at more than 40 fund-raisers.\nThe Boehner for Speaker campaign offers donors who give the maximum amount special perks, like \"meetings with\nLeader Boehner and much much more.\"\nBut his lobbyist friends and former aides said these incentives did not mean too much, because they already had plenty of\naccess to Mr. Boehner. They just now want to see him as the speaker of the House.\n\"He knows this is going to be a tough election,\" said Samuel J. Baptista, a friend, golf partner and lobbyist whose clients\ninclude Goldman Sachs and Discover Financial. \"But people who underestimate him really do so at their own peril.\"\n",

    "text": "Did this with Sean. Sid\n\nThe Political Scene\n\nConfounding Fathers\n\nThe Tea Party's Cold War roots.\n\nby Sean Wilentz October 18, 2010\n\nGlenn Beck's view of American history stems from the paranoid politics of the fifties.\n\nA few months ago, the cable-television and radio host Glenn Beck began his Fox News show with one of his favorite\nprops: a pipe clenched between his teeth. \"I've got my pipe,\" he told his audience, his speech slightly muddled by the\nstem, \"because we're going to speak about schoolish kind of things.\" The theme of the day was \"Restoring History,\" and\nBeck, looking professorial in a neat dark blazer and a pink button-down shirt, began the lesson by peering at a stack of\nhistory textbooks and pronouncing them full of falsehoods, produced by \"malicious progressive intent.\" Progressives, he\nexplained-liberals, socialists, Communists, the entire spectrum of the left-\"knew they had to separate us from our\nhistory to be able to separate us from our Constitution and God.\" For the next hour, Beck earnestly explained some of the\nhistory that \"is being stolen from us\": the depression of 1920, for example, or how conservative economics saved the\nnation from the \"near-depression\" of 1946-crises that progressives don't want you to know about. \"You've been taught\none lie, I think, your whole life,\" he said.\nFor the fractious Tea Party movement, Beck-a former drive-time radio jockey, a recovering alcoholic, and a Mormon\nconvert-has emerged as both a unifying figure and an intellectual guide. One opinion poll, released in July by\nDemocracy Corps, showed that he is \"the most highly regarded individual among Tea Party supporters,\" seen not merely\nas an entertainer, like Rush Limbaugh, but as an \"educator.\" And in the past few months Beck has established his own\ninstitute of learning: the online, for-profit Beck University. Enrollees can take courses like Faith 102, which contends with\n\"revisionists and secular progressives\" about the separation of church and state; Hope 102, an attack on the activist\nfederal government; and the combined Charity 101/102/103, a highly restrictive interpretation of rights, federalism, and the\ndivision of powers.\nDuring the \"Restoring History\" episode, Beck twice encouraged viewers to join his Web seminars, where they can hear\n\"lessons from the best and brightest historians and scholars that we could find.\" The B.U. faculty consists of three\nmembers, including one bona-fide academic, James R. Stoner, Jr., the chair of the political-science department at\nLouisiana State University; the other two are the head of a management consulting firm and the founder of WallBuilders,\nwhich the Web site calls \"a national pro-family organization.\" Beck himself often acts as a professor, a slightly jocular one,\non his Fox News program. Surrounded by charts and figures, he offers explanations of current politics and history lessons\nabout the country's long march to Obama-era totalitarianism. The decline, he says, began with the Progressive era of the\nearly twentieth century, in particular with the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, when both the Federal Reserve System and\nthe graduated federal income tax came into existence. \"Wilson,\" Beck told his radio audience in August, \"just despised\nwhat America was.\"\nBeck's claims have found an audience among Tea Party spokesmen and sympathizers. At the movement's Freedom\nSummit in Washington last September, one activist told a reporter, \"The election between Teddy Roosevelt and Woodrow\nWilson in 1912 was when it started going downhill.\" And in April an angry member of the Tea Party Patriots group from\nCape Fear, North Carolina, claimed on the group's Web site that \"the very things you see happening in this country today\nstarted with the Wilson Administration.\"\nAt a Tax Day rally this past spring, the veteran conservative organizer Richard Viguerie described the Tea Party as \"an\nunfettered new force of the middle class.\" And, indeed, calling Obama a socialist in the tradition of Woodrow Wilson is\naudacious enough to seem like the marker of a new movement-or, at least, a new twist in the nation's long history of\nconspiracy-mongering. In fact, it marks a revival of ideas that circulated on the extremist right half a century ago,\nespecially in the John Birch Society and among its admirers.\nBeck's version of American history relies on lessons from his own acknowledged inspiration, the late right-wing writer W.\nCleon Skousen, and also restates charges made by the Birch Society's founder, Robert Welch. The political universe is,\nof course, very different today from what it was during the Cold War. Yet the Birchers' politics and their view of American\nhistory-which focussed more on totalitarian threats at home than on those posed by the Soviet Union and Communist\nChina-has proved remarkably persistent. The pressing historical question is how extremist ideas held at bay for decades\ninside the Republican Party have exploded anew-and why, this time, Party leaders have done virtually nothing to\nchallenge those ideas, and a great deal to abet them.\nThe early nineteen-sixties were a turbulent time in American politics, for the right wing in particular. In the South, racist\nviolence against civil-rights workers was constant, deepening sectional splits in the Democratic Party that would in time\ndeliver the once solidly Democratic South to the Republicans. Southern elected officials, in support of what they called\n\"massive resistance\" to civil-rights laws and judicial rulings, resurrected the ideas of nullification and interposition, which\nclaimed that individual states could void federal laws within their own borders. Others focussed on what they considered a\nfear some Communist menace inside the United States. General Edwin A. Walker caused an enormous stir when he\nresigned from the Army in 1961, after President John F. Kennedy's Pentagon reprimanded him for spreading right-wing\n propaganda among his troops and accusing prominent American officials of Communist sympathies. Senator Strom\nThurmond, the Dixiecrat from South Carolina, spoke for many on the far right when he declared that various modestly\nliberal domestic programs \"fall clearly within the category of socialism.\"\nThe John Birch Society was one of the decade's most controversial right-wing organizations. Founded in 1958 by Robert\nWelch, a candy manufacturer from Massachusetts, the society took its name from a Baptist missionary and military-\nintelligence officer killed by Communist Chinese forces in 1945, whom Welch called the first American casualty of the\nCold War. The group was founded at a propitious time. After Senator Joseph McCarthy's fall, in 1954, many of McCarthy's\nfollowers felt bereft of a voice, and Welch seemed to speak for them; by the mid-sixties, his society's membership was\nestimated to be as high as a hundred thousand. Welch, exploiting fears of what McCarthy had called an \"immense\"\ndomestic conspiracy, declared that the federal government had already fallen into the Communists' clutches. In a tract\ntitled \"The Politician,\" he attacked President Dwight D. Eisenhower as \"a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist\nconspiracy\" who had been serving the plot \"all of his adult life.\" Late in 1961, after the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion, he\naccused the Kennedy Administration of \"helping the Communists everywhere in the world while pretending to do the\nopposite.\"\nWherever he looked, Welch saw Communist forces manipulating American economic and foreign policy on behalf of\ntotalitarianism. But within the United States, he believed, the subversion had actually begun years before the Bolshevik\nRevolution. Conflating modern liberalism and totalitarianism, Welch described government as \"always and inevitably an\nenemy of individual freedom.\" Consequently, he charged, the Progressive era, which expanded the federal government's\nrole in curbing social and economic ills, was a dire period in our history, and Woodrow Wilson \"more than any other one\nman started this nation on its present road to totalitarianism.\"\nIn the nineteen-sixties, Welch became convinced that even the Communist movement was but \"a tool of the total\nconspiracy.\" This master conspiracy, he said, had forerunners in ancient Sparta, and sprang fully to life in the eighteenth\ncentury, in the \"uniformly Satanic creed and program\" of the Bavarian Illuminati. Run by those he called \"the Insiders,\"\nthe conspiracy resided chiefly in international families of financiers, such as the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers, government\nagencies like the Federal Reserve System and the Internal Revenue Service, and nongovernmental organizations like the\nBilderberg Group, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. Since the early twentieth century, they\nhad done a good deal of their evil work under the guise of humanitarian uplift. \"One broad avenue down which these\nconspiratorial forces advance was known as progressive legislation,\" Welch declared in 1966. \"The very same collectivist\ntheories and demagogic pretenses which had destroyed earlier civilizations were now paraded forth in the disguise of new\nand modern concepts.\"\nIn the worst case, Welch believed, military action might be necessary to dislodge the totalitarians. But for the moment a\nnonviolent political revolution would suffice. Accordingly, he designed the Birch Society roughly, if not explicitly, on the\nMarxist-Leninist model of a vanguard revolutionary party: a series of small cells that would work in secret to agitate the\npopulace and elect right-thinking candidates to office. \"It isn't numbers we have to worry about,\" Welch wrote, \"but the\ncourage on the part of our followers to stick their necks out and play rough-the same as the Communists do.\"\nThe \"Founder\" himself would dictate the society's policies, advised by a council of about two dozen businessmen and\nprofessionals, and the local cells would be overseen by unyielding commanders. \"It is the leadership that is most\ndemanding, most exacting of its followers,\" Welch observed, \"that achieves really dedicated support.\" Welch's group\nbecame synonymous with right-wing extremism, earning satirical blasts from critics ranging from the cartoonist Walt Kelly\nto the musicians Bob Dylan and Dizzy Gillespie. The trumpeter, whose actual name was John Birks Gillespie, made a\nhumorous run for the Presidency in 1964, organizing John Birks Societies in twenty-five states.\nStill, the most outlandish of the era's right-wing anti-Communists was not Welch but Willard Cleon Skousen. A\ntransplanted Canadian who served as a Mormon missionary in his teens, Skousen was considered so radical in the early\nnineteen-sixties that even J. Edgar Hoover's F.B.I. watched him closely; one 1962 memo in his extensive F.B.I. file noted\nthat \"during the past year or so, Skousen has affiliated himself with the extreme right-wing 'professional communists' who\nare promoting their own anticommunism for obvious financial purposes.\" Skousen was himself employed by the F.B.I.,\nfrom 1935 until 1951, much of that time as a special agent working chiefly in administration. These desk jobs, he claimed\nimplausibly, gave him access to confidential domestic intelligence about Communism. Skousen also maintained that he\nhad served as Hoover's administrative assistant; Hoover informed inquirers that there was no such position.\nSkousen taught for years in the speech and religion departments at Brigham Young University, interrupted by a stint, from\n1956 to 1960, as the police chief of Salt Lake City. His time in office was contentious, and after he raided a friendly card\ngame attended by the city's right-wing mayor, J. Bracken Lee, he was promptly fired. Lee called Skousen \"a master of half\ntruths\" and said that he ran the police department \"like a Gestapo\"; Skousen's supporters placed burning crosses on the\nMayor's lawn.\nAfter losing his police job, Skousen founded a group called the All-American Society, which Time described in 1961 as an\nexemplar of the far-right \"ultras.\" Although he did not join the Birch Society, Skousen worked with its American Opinion\nSpeakers' Bureau, and, in 1963, wrote a rousing tract titled \"The Communist Attack on the John Birch Society,\" which\ncondemned the society's critics for \"promoting the official Communist Party line.\" (This was a tic of Skousen's; he later\ndefended the Mormon policy of denying the priesthood to blacks with a pamphlet called \"The Communist Attack on the\nMormons.\")\nAll along, Skousen's evolving thoughts ran in tandem with Welch's. In \"The Naked Communist,\" a lengthy primer\npublished in 1958, he enlivened a survey of the worldwide leftist threat with outlandish claims, writing that F.D.R.'s adviser\nHarry Hopkins had treasonously delivered to the Soviets a large supply of uranium, and that the Russians built the first\nSputnik with plans stolen from the United States. A year before Richard Condon's novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\"\nappeared, Skousen announced that the Communists were creating \"a regimented breed of Pavlovian men whose minds\ncould be triggered into immediate action by signals from their masters.\" A later book, \"The Naked Capitalist,\" decried the\nIvy League Establishment, who, through the Federal Reserve, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Rockefeller\nFoundation, formed \"the world's secret power structure.\" The conspiracy had begun, Skousen wrote, when reformers like\nthe wealthy banker Edward M. (Colonel) House, a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson, helped put into place the\nFederal Reserve and the graduated income tax.\nIn 1971, Skousen organized another group, the Freemen Institute, which he later renamed the National Center for\nConstitutional Studies. According to an article published in the Review of Religious Research, the center's targets\nincluded \"the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal\nCommunication Commission's fairness doctrine in editorial broadcasting, the federal government's change of the gold\nstandard in currency, all subsidies to farmers, all federal aid to education, all federal social welfare, foreign aid, social\nsecurity, elimination of public school prayer and Bible reading, and (that familiar right-wing nemesis) the United Nations.\"\nSkousen's pronouncements made him a pariah among most conservative activists, including some on the right-wing\nfringe. In 1962, the ultraconservative American Security Council threw him out, because members felt that he had \"gone\noff the deep end.\" In 1971, a review in the Mormon journal Dialogue accused Skousen of \"inventing fantastic ideas and\nmaking inferences that go far beyond the bounds of honest commentary,\" and advancing doctrines that came \"perilously\nclose\" to Nazism. And in 1979, after Skousen called President Jimmy Carter a puppet of the Council on Foreign Relations\nand the Rockefeller family, the president of the Mormon church issued a national order banning announcements about his\norganizations.\nSkousen was undeterred. In 1981, he produced \"The 5,000 Year Leap,\" a treatise that assembles selective quotations\nand groundless assertions to claim that the U.S. Constitution is rooted not in the Enlightenment but in the Bible, and that\nthe framers believed in minimal central government. Either proposition would have astounded James Madison, often\ndescribed as the guiding spirit behind the Constitution, who rejected state-established religions and, like Alexander\nHamilton, proposed a central government so strong that it could veto state laws. \"The 5000 Year Leap\" is not a fervid\nbook. Instead, it is calmly, ingratiatingly misleading. Skousen quotes various eighteenth-century patriots on the evils of\nwhat Samuel Adams, in 1768, called \"the Utopian schemes of leveling,\" which Skousen equates with redistribution of\nwealth. But he does not mention the Founders' endorsement of taxing the rich to support the general welfare. Thomas\nJefferson, for example, wrote approvingly in 1811 of having federal taxes (then limited to tariffs) fall solely on the wealthy,\nwhich meant that \"the farmer will see his government supported, his children educated, and the face of his country made\na paradise by the contributions of the rich alone, without his being called on to spend a cent from his earnings.\"\nSkousen also challenges the separation of church and state, asserting that \"the Founders were not indulging in any idle\ngesture when they adopted the motto 'In God We Trust.' \" In reality, the motto that came out of the Constitutional\nConvention was \"E Pluribus Unum\": out of many, one. \"In God We Trust\" came much later; its use on coins was first\npermitted in 1864, and only in 1955, at the height of the Cold War, did Congress mandate that it appear on all currency.\nThe following year, President Eisenhower-who Welch charged was a Communist agent-approved \"In God We Trust\" as\nthe national motto.\nBeck is no more the sole representative of today's multifaceted Tea Party than Welch or Skousen was of the nineteen-\nsixties far right; he recently told the Times, a bit disingenuously, that he was \"not involved with the Tea Party.\" Why, then,\nhave the politics of Skousen, Benson, and the John Birch Society had such a resurgence among conservative\nRepublicans-not just through Beck but through Tea Party heroes like the Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron\nAngle? (Last month, Angle gave a warm address to a \"freedom conference\" in Salt Lake City, co-sponsored by the John\nBirch Society and Skousen's old group, the National Center for Constitutional Studies, praising her audience as\n\"mainstream America\" and patriots who had \"heard the call.\") The columnist Frank Rich, among others, has suggested\nthat the election of a black President sowed \"fears of disenfranchisement among a dwindling and threatened minority in\nthe country.\" There are signs that this is so: Republicans' singling out of Thurgood Marshall as an \"activist Justice\" during\nElena Kagan's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the warnings on Fox News about the terrible dangers posed by the\nminuscule New Black Panther Party. But \"socialist\" is not a racial slur. Jim Crow was not built out of fears of the Federal\nReserve and the I.R.S. The Tea Party's fulminations against cap-and-trade, federal-government bailouts, and big\ngovernment generally play on very old themes that have nothing to do with the color of President Obama's skin.\nThe current right-wing resurgence has more to do with the inner dynamics of American conservatism in the past half\ncentury. In the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties, the far right was condemned by liberals, as might be expected; in\nNovember, 1961, President Kennedy devoted part of a speech in Los Angeles to denouncing those \"discordant voices of\nextremism\" that \"equate the Democratic Party with the welfare state, the welfare state with socialism, and socialism with\nCommunism.\" But the Bircher right also provoked deep anxiety among conservatives, who feared being perceived as\nparanoids and conspiracy-mongers.\nThe leading intellectual spokesman and organizer of the anti-Bircher conservatives was William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor\nof National Review. Buckley was by no means moderate in his conservatism. He was a lifelong defender of Joseph\nMcCarthy and a foe of New Deal liberalism. But he drew the line at claiming that the course of American government was\nset by a socialist conspiracy, and he feared that the ravings of the extreme right would cost more balanced, practical\nconservatives their chance at national power. \"By 1961,” his biographer John B. Judis writes, \"Buckley was beginning to\nworry that with the John Birch Society growing so rapidly, the right-wing upsurge in the country would take an ugly, even\nFascist turn rather than leading toward the kind of conservatism National Review had promoted.\" In the next two decades,\nwith Buckley's support and counsel, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan completed a conservative revolution that\nsucceeded by keeping extremist elements far from the centers of power.\nAs confidant and adviser to leading conservative politicians, Buckley had far more political influence than might be\nexpected from the editor of a weekly journal. Yet in the early nineteen-sixties he found fighting the Birchers and their\nfellow-travellers extremely difficult. Even though some of Buckley's colleagues at National Review thought that the Birch\nSociety went too far, they would not attack the society publicly, for fear of alienating both the Birchers and the\nconservatives who sympathized with their views. When Buckley wrote an editorial in 1962 that accused Welch of\n\"distorting reality\" and failing to make \"the crucial moral and political distinction\" between Communists and liberals, the\nmagazine immediately lost subscriptions and financial support.\nBy 1960, Senator Barry Goldwater, of Arizona, was emerging as the great political hope of conservative Republicans, and\nhe consulted closely with Buckley. At a meeting at the Breakers hotel, in Palm Beach, in January, 1962, Buckley urged\nGoldwater to repudiate the Birch Society. Goldwater demurred; though he conceded that some embarrassing \"kooks\"\nlurked among the Birchers, he insisted to Buckley that there were also some \"nice guys,\" and that it would be injudicious\nto attack the group in public. The Birchers' support helped gain Goldwater the Republican Presidential nomination in\n1964, and he winked at them in his acceptance speech with his famous line: \"Extremism in the defense of liberty is no\nvice.... Moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.\"\nIn the general election, though, Goldwater suffered a crushing loss to Lyndon Johnson, partly because Democrats\nsucceeded in making him look like a captive of the loony right. (To the Goldwater slogan \"In Your Heart, You Know He's\nRight,\" the Democrats shot back, \"In Your Guts, You Know He's Nuts.\") Buckley's fears had been confirmed. But he was\nundeterred in his efforts to build a respectable and viable conservative movement. In 1967, he favored Richard Nixon\namong a field of Republican aspirants. He liked Ronald Reagan's politics, but considered Reagan, who had only recently\nbeen elected the governor of California, too new to national politics. George Romney, the governor of Michigan, a wishy-\nwashy moderate, was obviously unsuitable, to say nothing of the Republican archliberal Nelson Rockefeller, of New York.\nNixon was a hard-nosed Republican with strong conservative views, especially on Communism and the Cold War; he had\nestablished himself as a Communist-hunter in the nineteen-forties by pressing the charge that Alger Hiss, a former official\nat the State Department, had spied for the Soviets. And, promisingly, Nixon was the front-runner. \"It seems to me that we\nought to have a real chance of winning this year,\" Buckley wrote to Goldwater around the time of the Republican National\nConvention. He served the campaign as an adviser, and by aiding his friend Frank Shakespeare, who had taken charge\nof Nixon's media operations.\nBut Buckley's candidate had a reputation for shiftiness that made him unpopular across the political spectrum. Some of\nthe editors of National Review, recalling that Nixon had cut a deal with Rockefeller in order to secure the G.O.P.\nnomination in 1960, didn't sufficiently trust him. And the Birch Society had nothing but contempt for the figure whom\nWelch had called one of \"the slipperiest politicians that ever showed up on the American scene.\" As President, in 1969,\nNixon began to open diplomatic relations with Communist China, and the right wing placed him on its list of perfidious\nappeasers. When he visited Beijing in 1972, even Buckley was deeply offended. But when the general election took place\nlater that year, with the antiwar Democratic candidate, George McGovern, voicing the country's anxieties over Vietnam,\nBuckley and the mainstream of what he called \"responsible conservatism\" returned to Nixon. The purist conservatives\nwere left to back the third-party candidacy of John Schmitz, a Republican congressman and a member of the John Birch\nSociety.\nNixon won in a landslide, and the next year he appointed Buckley the American delegate to the United Nations. The\nconservative pragmatists had found the way to real power. And, despite the embarrassment of Watergate, in Nixon's\nsecond term, their strategy proved effective over time. Nixon's campaign against McGovern sharpened the Democrats'\ninternal divisions over civil rights and Vietnam, and, Buckley wrote, revealed that the Democrats had \"an indifference\ntoward national independence and a hostility toward national freedom.\" Meanwhile, the Buckley mainstream, having read\nthe Birchers out of the conservative movement, established itself as a permanent and growing force in the Republican\nParty and in national politics.\nIn 1976, Buckley and National Review supported Ronald Reagan's primary challenge to Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford.\nAfter two terms as governor, Reagan had matured into what Buckley considered a nearly ideal conservative politician: a\nshrewd leader as well as a man of principle. Reagan nearly succeeded in wresting the nomination from Ford,\ndemonstrating how formidable a national figure he had become. The Bircher right had flourished in his political bastion of\nOrange County, and Reagan was adept at winning extremists' allegiance while he pursued realistic strategies. His\npragmatic side showed immediately after he finally secured the Republican nomination in 1980, when he chose the\nrelatively moderate George H. W. Bush, his bitter foe during the primaries, as his running mate. Though the decision\ndismayed right-wing ideologues, it had two practical benefits: it instantly healed the divisions between Republican\nmoderates and conservatives, and it helped dampen charges from the Democrats that Reagan was a reckless right-\nwinger. Nobody was more pleased by Bush's selection than his fellow Skull and Bones man William F. Buckley, who\nunderstood the political logic as clearly as Reagan had.\nAs President, Reagan flattered the extremists-he even delivered some admiring words about Skousen's Freemen\nInstitute-but he saved his political capital for his real goals: undoing the fiscal underpinnings of New Deal-style\ngovernment, and redirecting U.S. foreign policy by battling the Soviet Union and its proxies around the world. He\nappointed moderates to positions of importance, as when he made James Baker III, Bush's close associate, his first chief\nof staff, rather than the far more ideological Edwin Meese III, his former chief of staff from California. (As a top policy\nadviser, Meese helped Reagan stack the federal bench with conservatives, but he was otherwise eclipsed by Baker and\nBaker's deputy, the pragmatic Reaganite Michael Deaver, and his crusade, as Attorney General, to roll back civil-rights\nlegislation largely failed.) When zealots in the Administration were exposed, as in the Iran-Contra scandal, Reagan\nskillfully evaded responsibility and replaced them with more centrist Republicans. And, when he recognized in Mikhail\nGorbachev a Soviet leader with whom he could undertake genuine efforts to reduce the nuclear threat, Reagan pushed\nforward, ignoring the complaints that he had become, in the hard-liner Howard Phillips's phrase, \"a useful idiot for Soviet\npropaganda.\"\nWhatever misgivings may have arisen about him on the right, Reagan achieved a dramatic conservative overhaul of the\nfederal tax code, a profound reconfiguring of the judiciary, and a near-victory for the West in the Cold War. From the\nstandpoint of the mainstream right, the only problem with his legacy was that no other Republican could come close to\nmatching his public appeal and political savvy. For the party of Reagan, his departure was the beginning of a long decline,\nand it is the absence of a similarly totemic figure, during the past twenty years, that has allowed the current resurgence of\nextremism. George H. W. Bush repelled right-wingers with his moderate tendencies-not least when, in the face of fiscal\ncalamity, he broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes. Bill Clinton inspired them to an almost ecstatic series of\nattacks, and though there remained enough of an older conservative establishment, personified by Senator Bob Dole, to\ncheck some of the wildest charges, the new Republican House majority after 1994, pushed by such ideologues as Tom\nDeLay and Dick Armey, had little interest in maintaining the center. They harassed Clinton, forcing an impeachment even\nthough polls showed that more than sixty per cent of the American people disapproved. George W. Bush seemed at first\nto have a bit of Reagan's conservative charisma, but the right wing turned against him for failing to win the war in Iraq, for\nhis moderate position on immigration, and for spending hundreds of millions of federal dollars to combat the financial\ncollapse in 2008. When William F. Buckley died, during the 2008 primary season, it seemed to symbolize the end of a\nconservative era. David Klinghoffer, a former literary editor at National Review, lamented that \"urbane visionaries and\nbuilders of institutions\" such as Buckley have been replaced by media figures \"who make their money by stirring fears and\nresentments.\" Conservatism, Klinghoffer added, \"has undergone a shift toward demagoguery and hucksterism,\" and is\nnow ruled by those he called \"the crazy-cons.\"\nSome Republicans have tried to extend the Buckley tradition, but to little effect. The commentator David Frum, a former\nspeechwriter for George W. Bush, lost his job at the American Enterprise Institute after he complained about the\nRepublicans' obstruction of health-care reform and called the right-wing surge a threat to conservatism. In June, the\ncongressman Bob Inglis, of South Carolina, a tough conservative who nonetheless backed Bush's financial bailout, lost a\nvicious primary fight with a right-wing insurgent named Trey Gowdy. To his amazement, Inglis was confronted on the\ncampaign trail by voters who were convinced that numbers on their Social Security cards indicated that a secret bank had\nbought them at birth. \"And then, of course,\" he recalls, \"it turned into something about the Federal Reserve and the\nBilderbergers and all that stuff.\" Not even Karl Rove can afford open dissent with the Tea Partiers. Appearing on Fox\nNews the night of the recent primaries, he described the Tea Party-backed Senate candidate in Delaware, Christine\nO'Donnell, as probably unelectable and said that some of her statements were \"nutty.\" Instantly, criticism came from\nSarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, and other right-wing Republicans. Within days, he was back on Fox, proclaiming himself \"a\nhuge Tea Party fan,\" endorsing O'Donnell, and affirming that the National Republican Senatorial Committee would give\nher its full backing.\nSo far, Rove, an unlikely dissident, is the only prominent Republican leader to so much as gesture at stepping forward, as\nBuckley and his allies did. Even strong conservatives like Inglis have been pushed aside, as have such former G.O.P.\nstalwarts as Charlie Crist, in Florida, and Mike Castle, in Delaware, both beaten in the primaries by Tea Party candidates;\nCrist is now running a long-shot campaign as an Independent. Desperate for gains in the midterm elections, the\nRepublicans are neglecting the struggle it took to make politics safe for Reagan.\nFifty years ago, President Kennedy deplored the far right's \"counsels of fear and suspicion.\" Today, Obama's White\nHouse is still struggling to make sense of its enemies. In the absence of forthright leadership, on both the right and the\nleft, the job of standing up to extremists appears to have been left to the electorate. Candidates like O'Donnell may prove\ntoo eccentric to prevail, or voters may simply become disillusioned by politicians who campaign on their hatred of\ngovernment. After the election, mainstream conservatives may well engage in what Richard Viguerie has forecast as \"a\nmassive, almost historic battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party.\" (Already, Rove and some leading Bush\npolitical operatives, including the former Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie, have been quietly\nsupplanting the battered G.O.P. establishment in the effort to raise funds for this year's candidates.) But, according to a\nrecent poll, more than seventy per cent of Republicans support the Tea Party, and it seems almost certain that a\nRepublican Party that has unstintingly appeased the far right will enjoy a strong and perhaps smashing victory in the\ncoming midterm elections.\nIn 1906, early in the Progressive era, the humorist Finley Peter Dunne's fictional barroom sage, Mr. Dooley, put the social\nand political tumult of the day into perspective. \"Th' noise ye hear is not th' first gun iv a revolution,\" Dooley remarked. \"It's\non'y th' people iv th' United States batin' a carpet.\" A century from now, or even a year from now, Americans may say the\nsame about the Tea Party. For the moment, though, it appears that the extreme right wing is on the verge of securing a\ndegree of power over Congress and the Republican Party that is unprecedented in modern American history. For\ndefenders of national cohesion and tempered adversity in our politics, it is an alarming state of affairs. ◆\n\nRead more http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz?printable=true#ixzz123hWc5bz",

But the White House was no doubt responding to three realities.\nFirst, Boehner is an unknown to most Americans, which means that, unlike most\nRepublicans in the news, he has not been well branded by the GOP which means\nfor once Democrats might actually brand someone or something first rather than\nplaying catch-up. Second, Boehner would indeed be the highest-ranking Republican\nwere the GOP to assume control over the House (other than of course Karl Rove,\nwho is now directing traffic on the right side of the street in Washington\nagain). And third, a concrete face is always better than an abstraction when\ntelling a story, and other than perhaps Sarah Palin, who Republicans could\nalternately accept and decline as the leader of their party, Boehner's tanned\nvisage and history as errand-boy for virtually every major corporate special\ninterest in his two decades in Washington (including his stint as the Marlboro\nMan, handing out tobacco lobby campaign checks to his fellow Republicans on the\nfloor of the House) made him a potential counter-villain to the Republican's\nbogeywoman, Nancy Pelosi.\nI remained agnostic until this week, when colleagues at Media Matters Action\nNetwork and I conducted a national messaging survey\n<http://cloudfront.mediamattersaction.org/static/images/pdf/BrandingBoehner.pdf>\nwith 1,000 registered voters, selected to match the demographics of the voting\nand likely voting populations. The goal was to see how effectively we could\nspeak with voters about Boehner as not only the symbol and standard-bearer for\nthe GOP but also the water-boy for corporate America. (The results were\nsurprisingly similar whether we looked at registered voters or likely voters,\nalthough as others have described, precisely how to determine who is a \"likely\nvoter\" in this election is as much art as science, and the point of good\nmessaging at this point is actually to change the dynamics of likely voting, not\njust to reflect them.)\nAs detailed in a memo published in Politico, what we found was clear: Boehner is\na target well worth defining, who readily stands for precisely what Americans\nperceive to be the reasons they would have to hold their noses to vote for\nCongressional Republicans (perhaps the only group left who poll worse than\nCongressional Democrats with swing voters). We tested both paragraph-length\nnarratives and single-sentence language designed to capture the essence of those\nnarratives, and in each case, we tested them against the toughest opposition\nlanguage we could test them against: the words of Boehner, Cantor, Limbaugh and\nothers combined in defining the \"Obama-Pelosi-Reid\" agenda.\nWhat we found, in brief, is that is we could beat a tough GOP narrative about the\n\"job-killing\" socialists in the White House and Congress by 15 to 20 points with\ntwo narratives starring Boehner in the leading role (with best supporting bad\nactor going in one of the narratives to Karl Rove and his corporate allies), and\nwe could win with over 15 different sentence-long descriptions of \"what's the\nmatter with Boehner\" with margins ranging from 10 to 60 points against a tough\nconservative attack on the Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of conservative evil.\nThe narratives that most moved likely voters including swing voters, who\npreferred them by double-digits over tough Republican rhetoric\nmade clear\nwhose voices Boehner would be speaking for as Speaker (e.g., the Wall Street\nexecutives he convened to try to block Wall Street reform). They harnessed the\nsame populist anger at the hijacking of Washington by corporate special\ninterests that has enlivened the tea partiers and is palpable across the\npolitical spectrum, and they focused on the extremism of the party Boehner would\nSpeak for. A narrative that brought Karl Rove into the picture was slightly more\npolarizing with swing voters but slightly more powerful with likely Democratic\nvoters.\nIn some ways what was most surprising was the success of the single-line\nstatements of what we need in a Speaker and who John Boehner really speaks for\n(although these single-line statements came after the narratives, and likely\nreflect the power of branding, even over the course of a brief online encounter\nwith voters). They ranged from relatively lofty and aspirational (e.g., \"We need\na Speaker who is also a listener, who can hear the voices of ordinary Americans\"\n- a theme colleagues and I found highly resonant across the political spectrum\nin message testing on the role of money in politics) to the harder-edged\n(e.g., \"The Speaker of the House is a heartbeat away from the Presidency.\nUnfortunately, we know where John Boehner's heart is, and it isn't with the\nmiddle class,\" or \"John Boehner understands deficits. He's spent nearly 20 years\nin Washington creating them.\")\nIf there's a message in this message research, it is at once short-term and\nlong-term. In the short run, if Democrats want to hang onto their seats in\nNovember, they would do well to define this election in terms of the middle\nclass and small business versus the billionaires and big corporations that are\nhijacking our democracy; to use Boehner as a poster child for the party whose\nprimary commitment is to the latter and whose tan is a testament to that\ncommitment; and to avoid giving voters reason to regret their vote if they give\nit to Democrats again this time, by supporting the things they say they stand\nfor and avoiding that golden mean between the public interest and the special\ninterests that finance campaigns on both sides of the aisle.\nIn the longer run, branding matters. One of the biggest strategic and messaging\nmistakes of the last two years was the failure of Democrats to brand their\nopponents while their opponents were busy branding them and in particular the\nfailure to brand the Bush Recession as the natural consequence of failed\nRepublican economic principles. Two years ago, that was a virtually uncontested\npolitical proposition, as the voters made clear in handing Democrats the White\nHouse and supermajorities in both the House and Senate. Today, the public is\nsplit down the middle as to who caused the recession.\n\nReality doesn't brand itself. Hopefully it won't take a debacle in November and\nanother 10 million jobs lost for reality to unveil itself again for a brief\npolitical moment and for progressives to have a second bite at the apple.\n<http://getglue.com/?s=w>",

    "text": "This is the distilled, pure and utterly conventional wisdom of much of the DC political chattering class at this moment. The first two paragraphs are the most important, completely accurate in assessment, the rest twaddle:Monday, Oct. 11, 2010Why Obama Is Losing the Political WarBy Mark HalperinBarack Obama is being politically crushed in a vise. From above, by elite opinion about his competence. From below, by mass anger and anxiety over unemployment. And it is too late for him to do anything about this predicament until after November's elections.With the exception of core Obama Administration loyalists, most politically engaged elites have reached the same conclusions: the White House is in over its head, isolated, insular, arrogant and clueless about how to get along with or persuade members of Congress, the media, the business community or working-class voters. This view is held by Fox News pundits, executives and anchors at the major old-media outlets, reporters who cover the White House, Democratic and Republican congressional leaders and governors, many Democratic business people and lawyers who raised big money for Obama in 2008, and even some members of the Administration just beyond the inner circle. (See Obama's troubled first year, issue by issue.)On Friday, after the release of the latest bleak unemployment data - the last major jobs figures before the midtermsObama said, \"Putting the American people back to work, expanding opportunity, rebuilding the economic security of the middle class is the moral and national challenge of our time.\" But elites feel the President has failed to meet that challenge and are convinced he will be unable to do so in the remainder of his term. Moreover, there is a growing perception that Obama's decisions are causing harm - that businesses are being hurt by the Administration's legislation and that economic recovery is stalling because of the uncertainty surrounding energy policy, health care, deficits, housing, immigration and spending.And that sentiment is spreading. Many members of the general public appear deeply skeptical of Obama's capacity to turn things around, especially, but not exclusively, those inclined to dislike him - Tea Partyers and John McCain voters, but also tens of millions of middle-class Americans, including quite a few who turned out for Obama in 2008. (See how some Americans are facing the prospect of long-term unemployment.)The misery afflicting the country has no political affiliation. Listen to the voices from this striking TV ad for Rob Portman, the Republican former Congressman and Bush budget director who is running for Senate from Ohio. One woman at a Dayton career fair says starkly, \"There are no jobs.\" A man announces plaintively and with obvious frustration, \"I've been looking for a job now for 13 months.\" Events like this job fair are becoming the grim iconic gatherings of our time, the breadlines for the Obama years.Most of Obama's private (and sometimes public) rebuttals to the voices slamming him on all sides are justified or spot on. He did inherit a lot of problems from the Bush Administration. He did act quickly in the initial weeks of his Administration to stave off a worldwide depression. His efforts at job creation have been obstructed by Republicans (even the proposals based on policies supported by the GOP in the past). His opponents haven't put forth specifics of their own, nor offered genuine compromise, while the media have allowed the right's activists and gabbers to run wild with criticism without furnishing legitimate alternative solutions. (See Barack Obama's top 10 sound bites.)But Obama has exacerbated his political problems not just by failing to enact policies that would have actually turned the economy around, but also by authorizing a series of tactical moves intended to demonize Republicans and distract from the problems at hand. He has wasted time lambasting his foes when he should have been putting forth his agenda in a clear, optimistic fashion, defending the benefits of his key decisions during the past two years (health care and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, for example) and explaining what he would do with a re-elected Democratic majority to spur growth.Throughout the year, we have been treated to Obama-led attacks on George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, Congressman Joe Barton (for his odd apology to BP), John Boehner (for seeking the speakership or was it something about an ant?) and Fox News (for everything). Suitable Democratic targets in some cases, perhaps, but not worth the time of a busy Commander in Chief. In the past few days, we have witnessed the spectacle of the President himself and his top advisers wading into allegations that Republicans are attempting to buy the election using foreign money laundered through the Chamber of Commerce, combining with Karl Rove and his wealthy backers to fund a flood of negative television commercials. Not only is this issue convoluted and far-fetched, but it also distracts from the issues voters care about, frustrating political insiders and alienating struggling citizens (not that many are following such an offbeat story line). Feinting and gibing can't obscure those job numbers. (See the best viral campaign ads of 2010.)The President and Democrats have passed many significant measures (the stimulus spending, the auto-company rescue, the health care law and the financial regulation effort) that someday may be seen as brave and bold, the foundation for a better economy. Obama and his closest aides certainly think that will happen. But the President was correct when he said Friday, \"the only piece of economic news that folks still looking for work want to hear is, 'You're hired,'\" and that's still not occurring for too many Americans.The politically good news for Obama is that no matter what the outcome of the midterm elections, everything changes in January. Republicans will have a greater obligation, politically and morally, to help govern, rather than thwart and badger. The President will get a chance, in his State of the Union address and in his budget proposal, to show he is turning the page on the political horrors of 2010 for his party and the nation. But before then, Republicans are almost certainly going to demonstrate that you can beat something with nothing, especially when Americans seem to think that the Obama Administration hasn't much to offer either, except more of the same that isn't working.http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,2024718,00.htmlCopyright © 2010 Time Inc.

    "text": "FINANCIAL TIMES\nInnovative path for Egypt's entrepreneurs\nBy Ian Wylie\nPublished: October 10 2010 19:57 | Last updated: October 10 2010 19:57\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/ebfe3b30-d2e6-11df-9166-00144feabdc0.html\n\nThe Great Mosque of Cordoba in Spain is the inspiration for the grand, domed entrance to the American University in\nCairo's new campus. Its architects wanted to symbolise the height of intellectual and mathematical achievement in\nIslamic civilisation.\n\nBut this new $400m, 260-acre oasis of sandstone, mashrabiya window screens and malqaf windcatchers in the 40-\ndegree heat is also a hot spot of western credo: entrepreneurship.\n\nAn hour's drive east of Cairo's gridlocked streets, the Cairo desert campus is one of the first nodes in a network of\nuniversities and business schools that the US government is using to support and educate entrepreneurs in Egypt and\nother Muslim-majority countries.\n\n\"Tell me what innovation we Egyptians have done since the pyramids?\" asks Hassan Azzazy, a professor at AUC, who\npoints out that Egypt was ranked last in a study of education in 30 countries by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a not-\nfor-profit academic research consortium.\n\n\"Where are all the entrepreneurs? The Egyptian mindset needs to be rewired. We are not China - but we are blessed\nwith a large number of smart people, so education has to be the missing link.\"\n\nIt was to Cairo that Barack Obama, US president, came last year to announce foreign policy toward the Middle East and\nthat promoting entrepreneurship would be the platform for encouraging economic, political and social change.\nIt was Egypt that Mr Obama selected as the pilot country for a new Global Entrepreneurship Program. Some 17\norganisations have signed up to this US-inspired effort to educate Egyptian entrepreneurs - including AUC and Nile\nUniversity and their business schools, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Egyptian\nJunior Business Association.\n\nBut it is a project that might have caused even the Pharaohs to pause. Throughout its history, Cairo has been a\ncrossroads in the trade of spices, silk, incense and gold between Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Asia. But today\nEgypt is far from being a top entrepreneurial economy; the World Bank ranks it 106th among 183 economies in terms of\nthe ease of doing business. More significantly, says Prof Azzazy, young Egyptians still hesitate to take the entrepreneurial\npath.\n\nAccording to Prof Azzazy, the prevailing culture discourages entrepreneurship but exalts positions in academia or the\ngovernment. It does not help that going bankrupt is still a crime punishable by imprisonment. \"Parents in Egypt will tell\nyou, I want my son to have a government job, it's secure. Their children will say, I would like to start a business...but I\nmight lose money. We need to change this.\"\n\nProf Azzazy is not a professor of business but chemistry. At AUC, he has been replicating the work he pioneered at the\nUniversity of Maryland, where he helped teach biotechnology students the skills and training to spin out their ideas into\ncompanies. He has since introduced entrepreneurship courses in AUC's school of science to graduate students and in the\nengineering school to both degree and graduate students.\n\nIn 2008, he was appointed by the Ministry of Industry to work alongside ETF, a European Union agency that supports\neducation in countries surrounding the EU and has marked entrepreneurial learning as a priority. With the\nrepresentatives from 16 other countries, Prof Azzazy helped draft entrepreneurship education indicators and policy\nobjectives for both government and universities.\n\n\"We agreed that universities must implement entrepreneurial learning across campus and achieve a critical mass of\nprofessors who can teach it.\" After hosting a conference at AUC on the topic, Prof Azzazy convinced university provost\nLisa Anderson to pilot the indicators.\n\n\"But AUC has 6,000 students, compared with Cairo University, which alone has 250,000,” says Prof Azzazy. \"We need to\ntransfer this experience to larger universities, so we are in the process of developing a national policy to introduce\nentrepreneurship.\"\n\nProf Azzazy works in partnership with AUC's School of Business. \"I can teach biotech entrepreneurship, ethics and\nintellectual property, but I do not teach business planning or marketing\" he says. \"When it comes to that, we bring in\nfaculty from the school of business. I know the science, so I can speak the same language as my students, but we respect\nexpertise and we do not cross boundaries.\n\n\"We've also been thinking about introducing entrepreneurship into the core curriculum so that anyone coming to AUC,\nwhether they are doing music or engineering, would have to do it, regardless of their discipline.\"\n\nLast year, AUC restructured its School of Business to align undergraduate and graduate programmes with three themes:\nentrepreneurship, innovation and leadership. The school is also the location for one of Goldman Sachs's 10,000 Women\nin Leadership and Entrepreneurship Centres, where it delivers certificate programmes in partnership with the Wharton\nSchool at the University of Pennsylvania. The 10,000 Women initiative aims to boost the number of women in\ndeveloping nations who receive management training.\n\n\"Our mission is to educate principled, innovative entrepreneurs who can make a difference,\" says Sherif Kamel, dean of\nthe business school. \"It's more than just a fashion. We've been teaching entrepreneurship courses for 20 years but last\nyear we decided to look at it differently.\"\nIs he concerned that a chemistry professor is teaching entrepreneurship within his university? \"I think\nentrepreneurship is a very horizontal platform - knowledge should be shared by everyone and not dominated by one\nschool,\" says Prof Kamel. \"In business life, you work with people from different, complementary backgrounds.\n\n\"What Hassan is doing definitely complements what we are doing. And our students will be the beneficiaries.\"\n\nSeveral paths to the same goal\nOn the door of Steven Koltai's office at the State Department, Washington DC, is a banner that reads \"World Peace\nThrough Entrepreneurship\".\n\n\"I was an entrepreneur myself,\" says Mr Koltai, a senior adviser who created and now manages the Global\nEntrepreneurship Program. \"And I believe that entrepreneurship is something that is fundamental to every country in\nthe world.\"\n\nAccording to Mr Koltai, GEP consists of six categories of activity that he believes are needed to grow entrepreneurship:\nidentify, train, connect, guide to funding, sustain and celebrate entrepreneurs.\n\nIn Egypt, GEP is pulling together a number of training programmes, including those offered by AUC and Nile University,\nas well as non-government organisations, which provide training for entrepreneurs, such as the Cisco Entrepreneur\nInstitute, which has a centre in Egypt and in nine other Muslim-majority countries. In the US, the Legatum Institute\nCenter for Development and Entrepreneurship at MIT has created a two-week boot camp for up to 100 entrepreneurs\nidentified through business plan competitions around the world and taught by faculty from Harvard, Tufts, Wellesley\nand MIT.\n\nThere is no single path. \"Our different partners will offer boot camps that are two weeks long, some programmes that\nare six weeks long, full-time programmes or evening programmes.\n\n\"Our idea is to assemble a menu with as many choices as possible,\" says Mr Koltai.\n\nNone of the programmes is being underwritten by State Department money. \"We're giving them zero dollars. What we\nare doing is asking them to do more with their own resources,\" adds Mr Koltai.\n\n\"What we introduce to a country like Egypt is new organisations that were not previously there, such as American\nplayers, NGOs, universities, and foundations focused on entrepreneurship. However, we can also tap into existing US\ngovernment programmes from USAID or the departments of commerce, education or small business administration that\nmight be relevant. We are looking for countries near a tipping point to go entrepreneurial, but GEP will look entirely\ndifferent in each country.\"",

Cohen\nNovember 8, 2010 05:13 PM EST\n\nCalifornia Rep. Darrell Issa is already eyeing a massive expansion of oversight for next\nyear, including hundreds of hearings; creating new subcommittees; and launching fresh\ninvestigations into the bank bailout, the stimulus and, potentially, health care reform.\n\nIssa told POLITICO in an interview that he wants each of his seven subcommittees to hold\n\"one or two hearings each week.\"\n\n\"I want seven hearings a week, times 40 weeks,\" Issa said.\n\nIssa is also targeting some ambitious up-and-comers like Reps. Jason Chaffetz of Utah,\nPatrick McHenry of North Carolina and Jim Jordan of Ohio - all aggressive partisans\nto chair some of his subcommittees.\n\nHe also wants to organize aggressive oversight beyond his committee and plans to refer\ninquiries to other House panels, drawing even more incoming GOP chairmen to the cause\nof investigating the executive branch.\n\n\"As Clint Eastwood says, a man needs to know his limitations,\" Issa said in the interview.\n\"With other committees, we have good working relationships. Our committees have some\nareas of primary jurisdiction, including the federal work force, procurement and the Postal\nService. We will take care of our core knitting, but we have very narrow legislative\njurisdiction.\"\n\nWhile he promises an ambitious - and some say confrontational - agenda, Issa is\nmaking overtures to the Obama administration: He already has a meeting scheduled with\nVice President Joe Biden to discuss stimulus oversight.\n\nBut Issa's specific plans bring a certain reality to what has been known for months:\nOversight of the Obama administration and congressional Democrats will be a central\npurpose for the new Republican House.\n\nTo give an idea of how expansive Issa's oversight plans are, look at the record of Rep.\nHenry Waxman (D-Calif.) when he chaired the oversight committee during in the 110th\nCongress during George W. Bush's presidency. Waxman held 203 oversight hearings in\ntwo years; Issa has signaled he's prepared to hold about 280 in just one year.\n\nIssa sees the committee's role as not policy but to \"measure failures.\" He likens his job to\nseeing \"whether the fuel being consumed meets the specifications.\" And he isn't looking to\ncatch witnesses off guard, saying that \"oversight should be done with a balance for the\nAmerican people and not as a gotcha.\"\n\nIssa won't have a shortage of targets. He's been hammering for better tracking of the\nstimulus and has a growing list of other investigative targets, including the housing\nmeltdown and the bank bailout.\n\nEarlier this year, Issa pressured Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman\nEdolphus Towns (D-N.Y.) to issue a subpoena to Countrywide Financial about its VIP loan\nprogram. Other investigations during the minority included inquests into actions taken\nduring the financial meltdown and a look at problems with Toyota automobiles.\n\nThere are already résumés piling up for people looking to join Issa's staff - mostly\nlawyers, a source said.

He's also got inquiries into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's role in the\nfinancial collapse.

He is\nauthor of Republican Gomorrah: Inside the Movement that Shattered the Party (Basic/Nation Books, 2009). His website is\nhere\nSubjects:\n\n•\nDemocracy and government\n•\nInternational politics\n•\nUnited States\n•\ndemocracy & power\namerican power & the world\n•\n•\nrise of the new right\n\nThe rise of the Tea Party movement in the United States in the first twenty months of Barack Obama's presidency is\nshaking the political establishment, a trend reinforced by the victories of its candidates in Republican Party primaries. But\nwhere has the movement come from, and what is its inner life? Max Blumenthal\nbegin_of_the_skype_highlighting end_of_the_skype_highlighting, author of \"Republican Gomorrah\", enters the heady\nworld of the Tea Party to unravel the mix of driven personalities, feverish rhetoric, toxic hatreds, and flirtation with violence\nthat fuel its sub-culture's insurgent activism.\n\n\"He will tell you that he wants a strong authority to take from him the crushing responsibility of thinking for himself. Since\nthe Republic is weak, he is led to break the law out of love for obedience. But is it really strong authority that he wishes?\nIn reality he demands rigorous order for others, and for himself disorder without responsibility\" - Jean-Paul Sartre, Anti-\nSemite and Jew\n\nI am not sure when I first detected the noxious fumes that would envelop the conservative movement in the Barack\nObama era. It might have been in April 2009, when I visited a series of gun shows in rural California and Nevada.\nPerusing tables piled high with high-calibre semi-automatic weapons and chatting with anyone in my vicinity, I heard\nurgent warnings of mass roundups, concentration-camps, and a socialist government in Washington. \"These people that\nare purchasing these guns are people that are worried about what's going on in this country\", a gun dealer told me outside\na show in Reno. \"Good luck Obama\", a young gun enthusiast remarked to me. \"We outnumber him 100 to 1.\" At this time,\nthe Tea Party movement had not even registered on the national media's radar.\n\nIn September 2009, I led a panel discussion at the University of California-Riverside about my book Republic Gomorrah\n(Basic/Nation Books, 2009). Inside an auditorium filled with nearly 100 students and faculty, I sat alongside Jonathan\nWalton, an African-American professor of religious studies and prolific writer, and Mark Takano, an erudite, openly gay\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nB6\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\ni\ni\nformer Democratic congressional candidate and local community-college trustee. In the middle of our discussion, a dozen\ncollege Republicans stormed the front of the stage with signs denouncing me as a \"left-wing hack\" while a hysterical\nyoung man leaped from the crowd, blowing kisses mockingly at Takano while heckling Walton as a \"racist\". Afterward,\nuniversity police-officers insisted on escorting me to my ride after the right-wing heckler attempted to follow me as he\nshouted threats.\n\nWho was this stalker? Just a concerned citizen worried about taxes? His name was Ryan Sorba and he was an operative\nof a heavily funded national conservative youth outfit, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute. Besides founding dozens of\nRepublican youth groups across the country, Sorba has devoted an exceptional amount of energy to his interest in\nhomosexuals. His intellectual output consists of a tract titled The Born Gay Hoax, arguing that homosexuality is at once a\ncurable disease and a bogus trend manufactured by academic leftists. Adding to his credentials, Sorba has a history of\nrun-ins with the law, he explained when I called him about the order.\n\nMy encounter with this aggressive right-wing cadre seemed a strange, isolated event. But the hostility turned out to be\nsymptomatic of the intensifying campaign to delegitimise President Obama and his allies in Congress. The right's days of\nrage were only beginning.\n\nThe constellation\n\nThrough his first year in office, Obama seemed oblivious to the threat of the far right. He campaigned against\npartisanship, declaring that there were \"no red states\" and no \"conservative America\". Apparently, he thought it was\nmerely a contrivance or myth that there were people who rejected science, demonised gays, assailed minority and\nwomen's rights - not that they genuinely believed in what they said. Speaking of changing Washington, Obama seemed to\nthink that the entire history of politics since the rise of Ronald Reagan and the right and their strategies of polarisation was\nnot deeply rooted but a superficial problem attributable to certain \"divisive\" personalities, easily wiped away with gestures\ntoward bipartisanship. His view of the parties was that they were simply mirror images sharing fundamental beliefs but\nseparated by \"partisans\". The skilled and devoted community organiser could bring them together.\n\nMany of his supporters in the media, often partisans of political wars over the years, reinforced and amplified his\ninnocence, proclaiming he was the one at last who could \"bridge the partisan divide\". Andrew Sullivan, a disaffected\nconservative who once called critics of George W Bush policies \"fifth columnists\" but now fervently supported Obama,\nwrote that the new president was destined to become \"a liberal Reagan who can reunite America\". This optimism\npervaded the White House as the new president and his aides sought out Republicans willing to vote for his programmes.\nAfter all, why couldn't we all just get along?\n\nIn his autobiographical book The Audacity of Hope, Obama highlighted a key component of his political strategy: \"I serve\nas a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.\" Once he was elected,\nconservatives concluded that they could reverse Obama's strength by transforming him into a human tableau for the most\nfearsome images they could conjure (see \"Barack Obama, the fallen messiah\", 23 December 2009).\n\nObama's multiracial background was crucial in cultivating resentment among the shock-troops. Those who rejected\nObama's legitimacy to serve as president on the basis of his background gave birth to the \"Birther\" movement that sought\nto challenge his citizenship. The movement's most visible figure, and therefore the most eccentric, was Orly Taitz, a\ndentist and self-trained lawyer who had immigrated from the former Soviet republican of Moldova to Israel before settling\nin the conservative bastion of Orange County, California. Convinced by claims on the far-right website WorldNetDaily that\nObama planned to create a \"civilian national security force\", Taitz told me she \"realised that Obama was another Stalin -\nit's a cross between Stalinist USSR and Hitler's Germany.\"\n\nAfter becoming transfixed by online conspiracy theories claiming Obama's family had forged his birth-certificate in Hawaii,\nTaitz snapped into action. She filed a lawsuit in November 2008 with California's secretary of state Debra Bowen\ndemanding an investigation into Obama's eligibility to serve as president. Taitz's plaintiff in the case was Wiley Drake, an\nOrange County radio-preacher and former second vice-president of the Southern Baptist Convention who once publicly\nprayed for Obama's death. While her lawsuit went nowhere, and subsequent suits earned her angry rebukes from judges,\nTaitz became an instant media sensation, delivering heavily accented screeds against Obama before friendly interviewers\nfrom Sean Hannity to CNN's Lou Dobbs (the latter, described by Taitz as her \"greatest supporter\", was eventually fired as\nan indirect result of his hosting of her).\n\nIn March 2009, the Texas Representative Randy Neugebauer signed on to a Birther bill proposing that future presidential\ncandidates must prove their citizenship before becoming eligible to campaign. The Birther movement had found its voice\nin government and made an indelible impact on the Republican grassroots. By June 2009, 28% of Republican\nrespondents to a Kos/Research 2000 poll said they thought Obama wasn't born in the United States, while 30% \"weren't\nsure\". \"Obama should be in the Big House\", Taitz shrieked to me, \"not the White House!\"\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nWhen Obama announced healthcare reform as the first major initiative of his administration, the conservative movement\nactivated a campaign of demonisation - transformational politics - designed to turn Obama into the \"Other\", making him\nseem as unfamiliar, and therefore as threatening, as possible. When the president urged the Congress to deliver a\nhealthcare-reform bill in 2009, the right staged a living theatre of political hatred which turned Obama's dream of\nbipartisanship into a nightmarish version of Peter Weiss's Marat/Sade. On 12 September 2009, tens of thousands of far-\nright activists belonging to a loose confederation of anti-government groups called the Tea Party Patriots converged on\nWashington's National Mall for a giant protest against the Obama healthcare plan. The date was significant: Fox News's\ntop-ranked talk-show host Glenn Beck had declared the birth of the \"9-12 Project\" to restore the sense of unity (and siege\nmentality) that Americans experienced on 11 September 2001. But this time, Obama - not Osama - was the enemy.\n\nWhile covering the rally, I witnessed sign after sign declaring Obama a greater danger to America's security than al-Qaida;\ndemonstrators held images that juxtaposed Obama's face with images of evildoers from Hitler to Pol Pot to Bin Laden;\nothers carried signs questioning Obama's status as a United States citizen. \"We can fight al-Qaida, we can't kill Obama\",\nsaid an aging demonstrator. Another told me, \"Obama is the biggest Nazi in the world\", pointing to placards he had\nfashioned depicting Obama and House of Representatives' majority leader Nancy Pelosi in SS outfits. According to\nanother activist, Obama's agenda was similar to Hitler's: \"Hitler took over the banking industry, did he not? And Hitler had\nhis own personal secret service police. [The community-organising group] Acorn is an extension of that.\"\n\nThe seemingly incongruous Tea Party propaganda recalled signs waved by right-wing Jewish settlers during rallies\nagainst Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and his support of the peace process, portraying him as an SS officer and as\nthe French collaborator Marshall Pétain. In 1995, amid this provocative atmosphere, a young right-wing Jewish zealot\nassassinated Rabin. The Israeli tragedy was a cautionary example of targeted hatred leading to violence.\n\nMembers of the Tea Party \"Patriots\" did not seem to care that their rhetoric was irrational, or that comparing Obama to\nHitler and Stalin was contradictory and obviously hyperbolic. Their motives were entirely negative. By purging government\nof the multicultural evil that had seized power through illicit means (several activists told me they believed Acorn helped\nObama steal the election), they were convinced that a mythical golden American yesteryear would return. They had no\ninterest in building anything new or even articulating an agenda, much less discussing the merits of policies. The Tea\nParty's primary concern was cultural purification - freedom from, not freedom to. Against the dark image of the president\nand his liberal allies, Tea Party activists defined themselves as the children of light. The racial subtext was always\ntransparent.\n\nThe Tea Party's strategy rested on a guerrilla campaign of chaos and sabotage designed not only to intimidate Democrats\nbut also to disorient independent voters who might have supported healthcare reform. The Tea Partiers were convinced\nthis would be an easy feat, since they believed the majority of the country was on their side - that they represented the\n\"real America\". At the 9-12 rally Matt Kibbe, one of the march organisers, told the crowd that ABC News was reporting\nthat 1 million to 1.5 million people were in attendance; ABC denied this, saying \"ABCNews.com reported an approximate\nfigure of 60,000 to 70,000 protesters.\" Then one Dick Armey led the crowd in a chant of \"Freedom works! Freedom\nworks!\" Unknown to most of the Tea Partiers, they were intoning the name of a corporate-funded Beltway advocacy-\ngroup, not the battle-cry of Mel Gibson's version of William Wallace in Braveheart.\n\nIndeed, contrary to its image as a grassroots movement mobilised to stifle the machinations of Washington elites, the Tea\nParty movement was the creation of a constellation of industry-funded conservative groups with close Republican ties.\nThe movement's leading puppet-master was the same Dick Armey, who directed resources and talking-points to the Tea\nParty \"Patriots\" from his Washington-based advocacy group, FreedomWorks. Among the corporate clients of Armey's\nlobbying firm, which he was forced to leave as a result of his involvement in the Tea Parties, was the pharmaceutical giant\nBristol Myers Squibb, a company with a clear interest in defeating healthcare reform. (Armey's other \"real American\"\nclients included the Marxist terror-cult, the People's Mojahedin of Iran, which received funding and assistance from\nSaddam Hussein in order to launch terrorist strikes throughout the 1990s against Iranian civilian targets.) Armey collected\na consulting fee of $250,000 directly from FreedomWorks and $300,000 from allied astroturf front groups. FreedomWorks\npaid out much of its money to an assortment of Republican political consultants.\n\nThe rumour\n\nIf Dick Armey was the Tea Party king, Sarah Palin was eager to be crowned the Tea Party queen. Just days after\nObama's inauguration, Palin abruptly quit her job as Alaskan governor to vie for the honour. Palin's motives for quitting\nbecame clear when she inked a lucrative deal to write her political memoir Going Rogue, signed on as a regular\ncontributor to Fox News, and received $1 million an episode for a reality-show on cable television, \"Sarah Palin's Alaska\".\nPalin's book-tour, which sent her through Middle America in a luxuriously outfitted bus, resembled both a presidential\ncampaign and a travelling carnival.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\n1\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nWhether or not Palin intends to run for president, her growing media presence has magnified her influence within the\nRepublican Party. Yet the ever-expanding Palin phenomenon was greeted with hostility by Republican politicos\ndesperately seeking to expand the party's base after the drubbing in 2008. Steve Schmidt, formerly John McCain's\ncampaign manager in the doomed presidential campaign of 2008, warned that Palin's nomination in 2012 would be\n\"catastrophic\" for the GOP. His doomsday prediction was backed by an Gallup poll in October 2009 revealing her as one\nof the most polarising and unpopular political figures in the country with a disapproval rating of over 50%. Unfortunately for\nSchmidt and other party pragmatists, those who approve of Palin represent the heartbeat of the Republican Party, its\nmost fervent activists, and cannot be dissuaded from following her, even if she is leading the party off a cliff.\n\nA special congressional election in New York's heavily Republican 23rd district in November 2009 was the first major test\nof Palin's power. Along with a parade of nationally recognised conservatives, Palin endorsed Doug Hoffman, an unknown\nfar-right third-party candidate closely allied with the Tea Party - in the process helping to force a popular moderate\nRepublican politician, Dede Scozzafava, from the race. In the end, Palin's ideological purge in upstate New York led to an\nimprobable Democratic victory, the first in that district in more than 100 years. After the disaster Palin and her allies\nclaimed victory, insisting they had at least hastened the purge of ideologically impure Republicans from the party. She\nwent on to endorse Rand Paul, the son of right-wing libertarian Representative Ron Paul and a candidate in Kentucky's\nGOP senatorial primary; meanwhile George W Bush's vice-president Dick Cheney went out of his way to endorse Rand's\nregular Republican opponent, Trey Grayson, the Kentucky secretary of state.\n\nThe self-described \"hardcore pro-lifer\" Palin followed the Tea Party script of avoiding social issues like abortion and gay\nmarriage in order to obscure the large presence of the Christian right within the movement's ranks, recasting herself\naccordingly as a libertarian concerned primarily with issues of \"economic freedom\". She claimed the Democratic \"cap-\nand-trade\" plan to limit carbon-emissions would harm the livelihood of blue-collar workers, and she assailed healthcare\nreform as a Trojan horse for \"socialism\" (though she admitted her family \"used to hustle over the border\" to take\nadvantage of Canada's single-payer healthcare system). But no Palin attack had as much effect as the one she blasted\nout on her Facebook page claiming the Obama healthcare plan included a provision for \"death panels\" that would\nrecommend euthanasia for severely ill patients like her Down syndrome-afflicted son, Trig. With the click of a button, Palin\ntransformed the tone of the healthcare debate from rancorous to poisonous.\n\nThe source of Palin's \"death panels\" smear was a practiced propagandist, former New York's lieutenant governor Betsy\nMcCaughey. When Bill Clinton introduced healthcare reform during his first term as president, McCaughey falsely claimed\nin an article published in the New Republic that the plan would force consumers to drop their private plans and buy into\nthe government's programme (the article, widely circulated by Republicans, would go on to win a National Magazine\nAward, only to be retracted years later by the New Republic's editors). Now she was back in the spotlight, pushing a\nrumour that would be voted by the non-partisan fact-checking website Politifact.com as \"the lie of 2009\". McCaughey's\nlatest innuendo was boosted by the cult of political crank Lyndon LaRouche, which mobilised to push the rumour into the\nmainstream.\n\nIn June 2009, one of LaRouche's top lieutenants publicly confronted Ezekiel Emanuel, the National Institute of Health's\nchief bioethicist and brother of White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, accusing him of seeking to reintroduce Hitler's\nT-4 programme to kill the handicapped through healthcare reform. \"President Obama has put in place a reform apparatus\nreviving the euthanasia of Hitler Germany in 1939, that began the genocide there\", LaRouche staffer Anton Chaitkin\ncharged. Soon, LaRouche's followers were on street corners around the country with posters depicting Obama with a\nHitler moustache. At a townhall forum on healthcare reform hosted by Barney Frank, a Democratic Representative, a\nLaRouche follower waved one of the Obama-as-Hitler posters and demanded: \"Why do you continue to support a Nazi\npolicy, as Obama has expressly supported this policy?\"\n\nTwo months later, after Palin whispered the rumour on Facebook, prominent conservatives from former House speaker\nNewt Gingrich to ranking Senate finance-committee member Charles Grassley, parroted her claims before audiences of\nindignant Tea Partiers. Not to be outdone, Glenn Beck devoted an extended rant on his show to the reality of death\npanels. Beck, echoing the LaRouche cultists, accused Ezekiel Emanuel of \"the devaluing of human life, putting a price on\neach individual.\" He thundered, \"The death panel is not a firing-squad. Rationing is inevitable and they know it!\"\n\nThe death-panel rumour served a variety of functions, all useful to the movement, but not necessarily to the Republican\nParty. Most importantly, the rumour resonated both with hard-core libertarians who resented the very existence of the\nfederal government and Christian right activists who viewed the legalisation of abortion as a slippery-slope to government-\nsponsored euthanasia. The hysteria it engendered helped repair the rift exposed by the Terri Schiavo charade in 2005,\nwhen the evangelical conservative James Dobson publicly clashed with Armey, the libertarian leader, over the right of the\ngovernment to interfere in a private family matter of life and death.\n\nThe enemy\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\n!\ni\ni\ni\n!\nThe slurring of Obama as a sort of sleeper-agent crypto-Muslim helped bring the neo-conservatives back into the fray.\nThe new neocon generation was led by Dick Cheney's daughter, Liz, who founded an anti-Obama advocacy group, Keep\nAmerica Safe, by leveraging donations from pro-Israel sources. Asked by CNN's Larry King about the Birther movement\nthat was challenging Obama's status as an American citizen, Liz Cheney remarked: \"One of the reasons you see people\nso concerned about this is people are uncomfortable with having for the first time ever, I think, a president who seems so\nreluctant to defend the nation overseas.\" With the libertarians, Christian right, and the neocons seated around the same\ntable, united in resentment of the alien president, the conservative movement was whole again.\n\nThe experiments in \"terror-management theory\" developed by three professors of psychology (Sheldon Solomon of\nSkidmore College, Jeff Greenberg of the University of Arizona, and Tom Pyszczynski of the University of Colorado) have\ndemonstrated the connection between fear of death and intensification of conservative attitudes. The findings help explain\nthe effectiveness of the death-panel rumour and insinuations by conservative figures that Obama was not truly American\nand somehow sympathetic to Islamic terrorists. Indeed, these seemingly irrational smears were guided by tactical\nreasoning, calculated to agitate voters with constant reminders of their own mortality. Whether or not independent voters\nresponded, the rhetoric of death kept the Tea Party crowd in a persistent state of panic and rage, ensuring a standing\narmy ready to fan out to rallies and town halls at the first sign of liberal malfeasance.\n\nObama's first year in office was marked by more than raucous protests; there were several disturbing murders committed\nby far-right extremists. In April 2009, a 22-year-old neo-Nazi wannabe named Richard Poplawsi mowed down a Swat\nteam of Pittsburgh cops, killing three. Poplawski's best friend told reporters the young killer \"grew angry recently over\nfears Obama would outlaw guns.\" Later it was discovered that Poplawski had posted a video-clip to a neo-Nazi website\nportraying Fox's Glenn Beck contemplating the existence of concentration-camps. (After a characteristically thorough\ninvestigation, Beck conceded they were not real.) On another occasion, the killer posted a video promoting Tea Party\nrallies. A month after the Pittsburgh bloodbath, Scott Roeder, a supporter of the militant anti-abortion group Operation\nRescue, shot Dr George Tiller to death while he prayed at his church in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller was declared fair game by\nthe anti-abortion movement because of his role as Kansas's only late-term abortion provider. During at least twenty-eight\nepisodes of Bill O'Reilly's \"O'Reilly Factor,\" O'Reilly had referred to Tiller as \"Tiller the baby killer\", a criminal guilty of\n\"Nazi stuff.\" \"I wouldn't want to be [Tiller] if there is a Judgment Day\", O'Reilly proclaimed.\n\nIn August 2009, a middle-aged professional named George Sodini walked into a health club in suburban Pittsburgh and\ngunned down three women. The major media outlets explained Sodini's motives away by homing in on passages in his\nonline diaries describing his loneliness, inability to convince women to have sex with him, and descent into chronic\nmasturbation. Nearly every publication omitted or ignored a long deranged entry in which Sodini projected his sexual\nfrustration onto Obama, whom he seemed to view as a symbol of black male virility and predation.\n\nThe day after Obama's election victory, Sodini wrote: \"Good luck to Obama! He will be successful. The liberal media\nLOVES him. Amerika has chosen The Black Man. Good! In light of this I got ideas outside of Obama's plans for the\neconomy and such. Here it is: Every black man should get a young white girl Kinda a reverse indentured servitude\nthing. Every daddy know when he sends his little girl to college, she be ... real good. I saw it. 'Not my little girl', daddy\nsays! (Yeah right!!) Black dudes have thier [sic] choice of best white?? [ellipses in original].\"\n\nIn another posting to an anti-Clinton forum in 1994, during the height of the Republicans' Whitewater investigation, Sodini\nrevealed that he had purchased a bumper-sticker reading, \"Stop Socialism, Impeach Clinton,\" from a National Review ad.\nA year later, Sodini ranted on an anti-government militia site: \"I am convinced that more drastic action is required to bring\nthe country back to the Constitutional order that it was 200 years ago. I don't think any group of political leaders will\nachieve this for us.\" Whether or not Sodini's murder-spree was motivated by his political passions, he was pathologically\ndeath-driven and fixated on the phantasmagoria of right-wing imagery. In his final diary entry, Sodini proclaimed: \"Death\nlives!\"\n\nThe bible\n\nMore than any other media figure of the Obama era, Glenn Beck encouraged the campaign of racial demonisation and\nconspiracy that consumed the Tea Party \"Patriots\". During a broadcast of \"Fox and Friends\", Beck opined that Obama\n\"has exposed himself over and over and over again as a guy who has a deep-seated hatred for white people, or the white\nculture.\" As evidence, Beck pointed to White House green-jobs czar Van Jones, an African-American former community\norganiser who was eventually forced to resign as a direct result of Beck's crusade. From there, Beck targeted another\nblack Obama adviser, Valerie Jarrett, highlighting her ties to Acorn while upholding her and Jones as evidence of\nObama's \"socialist\" agenda. In another broadcast, Beck played an audio clip of unidentified African-Americans referring to\n\"Obama money\" as they collected welfare-cheques in Detroit. Then he showed footage of members of a Kansas City-\nbased youth group practicing a step show, a traditional African-American group dance apparently unfamiliar enough to\nBeck and his transfixed audience that he felt at liberty to claim the footage as evidence that \"Obama's SS\" was being\ntrained across inner-city America.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\n!\n1\ni\n|\ni\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nIn September 2009, Beck relentlessly targeted Acorn, the right's new favourite hobgoblin, admitting that he intended to\nuse the poor people's advocacy group to distract his viewers from the healthcare debate. \"Trust me\", Beck said,\n\"Everybody now says they're going to be talking about healthcare. I don't think so.\" (His statement was reminiscent of\nRush Limbaugh's scandal-mongering remark during the early Clinton administration: \"Whitewater is about healthcare.\")\n\nBeck promptly cued up a series of hidden-camera videos shot by conservative youth activists James O'Keefe and Hannah\nGiles inside Acorn field offices.\nIn the videos, O'Keefe baited African-American staffers into making statements explaining that Giles, who claimed she\nwas a prostitute, could obtain low-income housing. O'Keefe edited in images of himself clad in an outlandish pimp\ncostume to create the impression that he was dressed that way during the meetings with Acorn; however, Giles later\nadmitted her partner had lied about wearing his costume to further incriminate Acorn. In the end, Acorn was exonerated of\nall criminal wrongdoing.\n\nIn a separate incident O'Keefe was arrested and charged with a federal crime after he and several conservative pals\ndisguised themselves as telephone repairmen and attempted to wiretap phone-lines in the office of Senator Mary\nLandrieu of Louisiana. Like Ryan Sorba, O'Keefe and his posse were movement cadres paid and directed by well-funded\nconservative outfits; O'Keefe had been trained by the Leadership Institute, the right-wing youth group that nurtured\nleading lights like Jack Abramoff, Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and Jeff Gannon.\n\nWhile O'Keefe and his buddies plea-bargained with prosecutors, Beck basked in his formula for success. His show earned\nthe highest ratings at Fox News, topping network franchises like O'Reilly and Sean Hannity. In the process, Beck's\nopinions became firmly implanted in the nervous systems of Tea Party activists. \"Glenn Beck has taught us everything we\nknow\", a demonstrator at the 9-12 rally told me. \"He's opened our eyes to so much.\"\n\nBut unlike the right-wing radio warhorses who helped usher in Newt Gingrich's Republican counter-revolution of 1994,\nBeck was not an authentic product of the movement. When Rush Limbaugh first began dominating the AM airwaves,\nBeck was mired in the world of mid-level commercial radio, delivering corny yarns about lesbians and celebrity trash in\nhopes of becoming the next Howard Stern. By night, as he has tirelessly recounted, he medicated his anxiety with cocaine\nand alcohol, destroying his first marriage in the process. \"We remember Glenn from the womanising, the drinking, the\ndrugs. Everybody who knew him at the time saw what a complete mess he was\", a shock- jock from Tampa, Florida, who\ncalled himself Bubba the Love Sponge remarked to me during a broadcast of his nationally syndicated show.\n\nLike Dusty Rhodes, the pseudo-populist demagogue of Elia Kazan's 1957 film, A Face in the Crowd, Beck was a self-\ndestructive drifter who might have been crumpled up with a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 in an alleyway or been locked away\nin a prison cell had fame not found him first. Beck was only able to stabilise his life when he made his escape from\nfreedom, marrying a conservative Mormon, converting to her religion, and transmuting his urge to abuse drugs into\nconservative radio diatribes.\n\nWhen Beck first broke into television on CNN's Headline News Channel, he struggled to articulate a coherent political\nworldview. If he distinguished himself from other big-time conservative hosts in any way, he did so through strained and\noften snide attempts at humour, remnants of his failed radio career. Nevertheless, with help from his liberal agent,\nMatthew Hiltzik, Beck snagged a primetime slot at Fox News in early 2009. Around this same time, Beck began promoting\nthe work of an arcane Mormon conspiracy-peddler named W Cleon Skousen, whom he described as his political lodestar.\nSuddenly, Beck had something more to offer than irritable mental gestures.\nThanks to Beck's designation of Skousen's pseudo-historical tract The 5000 Year Leap as \"required reading\" on the\nwebsite of his 9-12 Project, and his promotion of the book on his show, the previously obscure Skousen became the\nHidden Imam of the Tea Party movement. By summer 2009, Skousen's Leap was among the top ten books on Amazon\nand a fixture on literature tables at Tea Party gatherings. It went from selling a puny couple of thousand copies in 2007 to\nselling over 200,000 copies in 2009. Just why the book generated such an instant appeal is difficult to understand. It is\nlittle more than a slapdash of quotes from the Founding Fathers, often taken out of context and deliberately oversimplified,\nto explain why America is the greatest nation in history. In the process, Skousen claims that church and state separation\nis un-American, that \"coercive taxation\" is communist, and that marriage is the underpinning of a free society. Benjamin\nFranklin, who wrote at length on the merits of \"amours\" with \"old women,\" and who famously solicited prostitutes and\nfathered a son of out of wedlock, was the ultimate authority Skousen quoted on the importance of marriage.\n\nThough Skousen claims the Founders as the world's foremost source of eternal wisdom, he buttressed his points with\nfringe sources like the conspiracist Norman Dodd's screeds about the Illuminati. According to Skousen, Dodd claimed that\n\"powerful influences congregating in the United States\" like the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds had forced the United\nStates into the first world war. Skousen published Dodd's manifestoes in his obscure journal Freemen's Digest, which he\nfounded for the express purpose of propagating conspiracies.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\n!\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\nSkousen's paranoid politics were an outgrowth of his participation in extreme anti-communist groups during the 1950s. He\nboasted of a close friendship with then-FBI director J Edgar Hoover and said he provided him with research on communist\nplots, claims disputed by FBI historians. (During a recent interview, Skousen's son, Paul, told me that contrary to rumours\nof Hoover's cross-dressing and homosexual dalliances, he would set the top cop up on blind dates with live women.)\nSkousen was fired from his job as Salt Lake City's police chief for, in the words of the city's conservative Mormon mayor,\n\"conduct[ing] his office as chief of police in exactly the same manner in which the communists operate their government.\"\nFrom there, Skousen sailed off to the far shores of the right-peddling conspiracy tracts like The Naked Communist, and\nearning condemnation from his beloved FBI, which accused him in an internal memo of \"promoting [his] own anti-\ncommunism for obvious financial purposes.\"\n\nSkousen's vocal support for the far-right John Birch Society's claim that communists controlled President Dwight\nEisenhower cost him the support of the corporate backers who had paid for his Red-bashing lecture tours. He went off the\nradar for several years, returning during the late 1960s to accuse the Jewish Rothschild family of secretly bankrolling\neveryone from Ho Chi Minh to the civil-rights movement. By the late 1970s, even the Church of Latter-Day Saints\ndistanced itself from Skousen and his conspiracy theories. His work fell through the margins and might have disappeared\nentirely had Beck not revived it, turning The 5000 Year Leap into the bible of the Tea Party movement. Alexander Zaitchik\nobserved in his authoritative profile of Skousen on Salon that Skousen's renewed influence through Beck and the Tea\nParty \"suggests that the modern base of the Republican Party is headed to a very strange place.\"\n\nThe descent\n\nBesides influencing Beck, Skousen's teachings inspired one of the Tea Party movement's most visible grassroots\ncelebrities, retired sheriff Richard Mack. I met Mack in February at a far-right rally just outside of Montgomery, Alabama.\nOn a makeshift stage towed into the middle of a rodeo arena by a pickup truck, Mack recalled with reverence his\nmentorship by Skousen, who he said taught him everything he needed to know about the constitution. Mack urged his\nspellbound audience to stockpile ammo and store food. \"If you control the food supply\", Mack warned, \"you control the\npeople. And that's the first step to slavery.\"\n\nAlready a hero to conservatives for successfully suing the Clinton administration over the provision in the Brady Handgun\nViolence Prevention Act requiring law enforcement to conduct criminal-background checks of gun purchasers, Mack\nreemerged in the Obama era as the archetypal local lawman who vowed to resist the tyrannical federal government.\nAlong with a few dozen former and active military and law-enforcement personnel, Mack helped form a self-styled Tea\nParty militia called the Oathkeepers. Galvanised by their fear of creeping socialism, the Oathkeepers solemnly swore to\nrefuse tyrannical federal orders such as cooperating with foreign troops and forcing Americans into concentration-camps.\nBecause the group's members trained for combat, the vow came with suggestion of armed resistance.\n\nBesides Mack, the Oathkeepers attracted a coterie of militia-movement retreads into its ranks. The most well-established\nfigure was Mike Vanderboegh, a longtime militia fanatic who published a booklet in the mid-1990s entitled Strategy and\nTactics for a Militia Civil War, calling for sniper attacks on \"war criminals, secret policemen, rats.\" With Obama in office,\nVandeboegh churned out anti-government screeds on right-wing blogs with renewed passion and supported his efforts by\ncashing in the $1,300 in federal disability compensation he received each month.\n\nFor all the energy the far right exerted in its campaign to strangle Obama's agenda, it was a Democrat who posed the\ngreatest threat to the passage of healthcare reform. Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan had been in office since\n1993, placing him among the senior leadership of the so-called centrist Blue Dog Democrats. When healthcare reform\nwas introduced in Congress, Stupak became the leader of an informal caucus of anti-abortion Democrats, making him the\nde facto swing vote on the House version of the bill. By extension, Stupak was the point man in the campaign to ensure\nthat the bill would not allow federal funding for abortion for low-income women.\n\nBut after close consultation with leaders of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, Stupak went a step further. He\nintroduced a draconian amendment to block women from paying for abortions from even their own private insurance\nplans. The amendment, which passed the House but was shut down in the Senate, became a key sticking point in\nhealthcare negotiations. \"He's a big hero now in the pro-life community\", Deal Hudson - former Catholic issues adviser to\nGeorge W Bush - told me in November 2009. \"Thanks to him, this is the first time I can remember the pro-life Democrats\nhaving any power.\"\n\nTo the chagrin of the Republicans, Stupak entertained offers of compromise from the Democratic leadership. According to\nHudson, the Catholic bishops were keen to see healthcare reform pass, but only if the bill contained a clear provision\nforbidding patients from spending federal money on abortion. Finally, in March 2010, after pressure from Nancy Pelosi,\nObama agreed to sign an executive order forbidding the federal funding of abortion. Stupak had been mollified. Now he\nand his anti-abortion caucus pledged to deliver the swing votes the Democrats needed to pass the bill. As soon as reports\nseeped out declaring the imminent passage of healthcare reform, major right-wing blogs like RedState.org churned out\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\n|\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015\ni\n:\ni\n:\n!\nvirulent denunciations of Stupak, calling him a traitor and sellout. The blog comment sections filled up with dozens of\ndiatribes referring to Stupak in language previously reserved for Dr George Tiller: \"Bart the Baby-Killer.\"\n\nOn 20 March 2010, thousands of Tea Party activists surrounded the Capitol's Longworth Building in expectation of\nObama's pep talk to the House Democrats and the healthcare vote. Democratic Representative John Lewis, a hero of the\ncivil-rights movement, and Representative Barney Frank, the first openly gay member of Congress, passed through the\ncrowd on their way inside the Capitol. \"Nigger!\" a demonstrator barked at Lewis. Another called Frank a \"faggot\", eliciting\nlaughter and cheers from nearby protesters. Meanwhile, as another African-American Democrat, Representative Emanuel\nCleaver, ascended the Capitol steps, a protester who had been screaming at Lewis and Frank spat on his face.\n\nWith the demonstration carried on into the night, cries of \"Kill the bill!\" drifted into calls for violence. \"I would gladly stand\nwith any of you men here and take these fascists down\", a man in camouflage battle-dress uniform proclaimed in front of\nan amateur videographer, pointing toward the Capitol. \"You haven't heard the last of me!\"\n\nThe next day, Republican members of Congress emerged from the Longworth Building to salute the Tea Partiers. The\ndemonstrators cheered wildly for their proxies on the inside. Finally, after hours of impassioned speeches on the House\nfloor, the bill passed. But the drama was hardly over.\n\nRepublican Representative Joe Pitts, an anti-abortion Catholic who co-authored Stupak's original amendment, demanded\na motion to bring it back to the floor for a vote, a transparent exercise in grandstanding that was certain to fail. In\nresponse, Stupak rushed to the podium with a stinging rebuke to Pitts and the Republicans. \"The motion to commit does\nnot support life\", Stupak declared. \"It is the Democrats who have stood up....\" Heckling from the Republican side\ninterrupted his statement. As Stupak looked around the House chamber, Representative Randy Neugebauer, a right-wing\nRepublican from Texas who openly supported the Birther movement, began shouting at him from the backbench, \"Baby\nkiller!\" Other Republicans joined in, parroted base insults.\n\nWhile the Republicans sank their heads in defeat, some more militant devotees of the Tea Party movement called for a\nright-wing Kristallnacht. \"If you wish to send a message that Pelosi and her party cannot fail to hear, break their windows\",\nVanderboegh of the Oathkeepers wrote on a far-right blog hours after the bill passed. \"Break them NOW. Break them and\nrun to break again.\" Within three days, windows and doors at Democratic Party headquarters in New York, Kansas and\nArizona had been shattered.\n\nMeanwhile, at least ten Democratic members of Congress reported receiving death threats. Images of nooses were faxed\nto the offices of Stupak and James Clyburn, an African-American congressman from South Carolina. Representative\nAnthony Weiner, an especially vocal proponent of healthcare reform, received a menacing letter filled with white powder.\nThe brother of Representative Tom Perriello, another healthcare supporter, had his home gas line deliberately sabotaged\nafter a local Tea Party organiser posted his address online (he had meant to post the congressman's) and encouraged\nactivists to \"drop by\" to express their anger about Perriello's recent vote. In Tucson, Arizona, the windows of Democratic\nRepresentative Gabrielle Giffords' office were shattered by shots from a pellet gun. And a brick was thrown through the\nwindow of Representative Louise Slaughter's office in New York as her voicemail filled with threats of impending sniper\nattacks.\n\nAfter the passage of the healthcare bill, the Tea Party floated into a grey zone between authoritarianism and anarchy.\nCrusading to restore a holy social order, they promoted disorder. Claiming to protect democracy, they smashed windows\nof elected representatives. Warning of death panels, they called in death threats. With the atmosphere of violence\nthickening, Palin took to her Twitter account to issue a battle-cry: \"Don't Retreat, Instead-RELOAD!\" Thus concluded the\nfirst phase of the Obama era that was to usher in a peaceable kingdom of bipartisanship.\n\nUNCLASSIFIED U.S. Department of State Case No. F-2014-20439 Doc No. C05773028 Date: 08/31/2015",

    "text": "Tomgram: Max\nBlumenthal, The Great\nFear\nBy Max Blumenthal\nPosted on December 19, 2010, Printed on\nDecember 20, 2010\nhttp://www.tomdispatch.com/blog/175334/\n\nMoments of imperial and economic decline\naccording to a recent poll, 65% of\nAmericans now believe this country to be\n\"in a state of decline\" can also be periods\nof cultishness, even of madness\nincarnate. Such a mood now seems to be\nspreading through the United States. It's\nnot so surprising, really. Since the attacks\nof September 11, 2001, fear has\nbeen injected into this \"homeland\" like a\ndrug and a penumbra of official secrecy has\nsettled over the land in a way that makes\nthe secrecy of the Cold War years (when\nthis country faced a superpower, not a\nragtag set of jihadis, guerrillas, and\nterrorists) seem like an era of sunshine.\nIn an atmosphere of swirling fears and\nhysteria amid declining living conditions,\n\"explanations\" that at other times might\nhave remained confined to tiny crews of\nconspiracy-mongers can suddenly gain a\npatina of plausibility and so traction. No\nwonder then that, as hard times hit, as the\nfinancial system seemed on the verge of\ncollapse, as unemployment soared and a\nmassive wave of home foreclosures swept\ninto view, increasing numbers of\nAmericans became prey to any wacky\nexplanation for our troubles, none more so\nthan the idea that Islam was somehowresponsible, that mosques and Islamic\ncenters meant for a sliver of a minority here\nwere capable of imposing anything, no less\na way of life on this country, or that Sharia\nlaw (of all things) might somehow worm\nits way into state legal systems, or that\nYouTube was a hotbed of terrorism worthy\nof suppression, or... well, you name it.\nMax Blumenthal, author of the bestselling\nbook Republican Gomorrah: Inside the\nMovement That Shattered the Party, has\ndone the necessary legwork to take us deep\ninto one of those crews of conspiracy-\nmongers who, at another time, just about\nno one would have paid much attention to,\nbut in twenty-first-century America have\ngained a remarkable audience. They are a\nchilling barometer of the changing weather\nin America. Tom\nThe Great\nIslamophobic\nCrusade\nInside the Bizarre\nCabal of Secretive\nDonors, Demagogic\nBloggers, Pseudo-\nScholars, European\nNeo-Fascists, Violent\nIsraeli Settlers, and\nRepublican Presidential\nHopefuls Behind the\nCrusade\nBy Max Blumenthai\nNine years after 9/11,\nhysteria about Muslims in\nAmerican life has gripped\nthe country. With it has\ngone an outburst of arson\nattacks on mosques,\ncampaigns to stop their\nconstruction, and the\nbranding of the Muslim-\nAmerican community,\noverwhelmingly moderate,\nas a hotbed of potential\nterrorist recruits. The frenzy\nhas raged from ruralTennessee to New York\nCity, while in Oklahoma,\nvoters even overwhelmingly\napproved a ballot measure\nbanning the implementation\nof Sharia law in American\ncourts (not that such a\nprospect existed). This\ncampaign of Islamophobia\nwounded President Obama\npolitically, as one out of five\nAmericans have bought\ninto a sustained chorus of\nfalse rumors about his secret\nMuslim faith. And it may\nhave tainted views of\nMuslims in general; an\nAugust 2010 Pew Research\nCenter poll revealed that,\namong Americans, the\nfavorability rating of\nMuslims had dropped by 11\npoints since 2005.\nErupting so many years after\nthe September 11th trauma,\nthis spasm of anti-Muslim\nbigotry might seem oddly\ntimed and unexpectedly\nspontaneous. But think\nagain: it's the fruit of an\norganized, long-term\ncampaign by a tight\nconferation of right-wing\nactivists and operatives who\nfirst focused on\nIslamophobia soon after the\nSeptember 11th attacks, but\nonly attained critical mass\nduring the Obama era. It\nwas then that embittered\nconservative forces, voted\nout of power in 2008, sought\nwith remarkable success to\nleverage cultural resentment\ninto political and partisan\ngain.\nThis network is obsessively\nfixated on the supposed\nspread of Muslim influence\nin America. Its apparatus\nspans continents, extendingfrom Tea Party activists here\nto the European far right. It\nbrings together in common\ncause right-wing ultra-\nZionists, Christian\nevangelicals, and racist\nBritish soccer hooligans. It\nreflects an aggressively pro-\nIsrael sensibility, with its\nkey figures venerating the\nJewish state as a Middle\nEastern Fort Apache on the\nfront lines of the Global\nWar on Terror and urging\nthe U.S. and various\nEuropean powers to emulate\nits heavy-handed methods.\nLittle of recent American\nIslamophobia (with a strong\nemphasis on the \"phobia\") is\nsheer happenstance. Years\nbefore Tea Party shock\ntroops massed for angry\nprotests outside the\nproposed site of an Islamic\ncommunity center in lower\nManhattan, representatives\nof the Israel lobby and the\nJewish-American\nestablishment launched a\ncampaign against pro-\nPalestinian campus activism\nthat would prove a seedbed\nfor everything to come. That\ncampaign quickly -- and\nperhaps predictably\nmorphed into a series of\ncrusades against mosques\nand Islamic schools which,\nin turn, attracted an\nassortment of shady but\nexceptionally energetic\nmilitants into the network's\nranks.\nBesides providing the initial\nenergy for the Islamophobic\ncrusade, conservative\nelements from within the\npro-Israel lobby bankrolled\nthe network's apparatus,\nenabling it to influence thenational debate. One\nphilanthropist in particular\nhas provided the\nbeneficence to propel the\ncampaign ahead. He is a\nlittle-known Los Angeles-\narea software security\nentrepreneur named Aubrey\nChernick, who operates out\nof a security consulting firm\nblandly named the National\nCenter for Crisis and\nContinuity Coordination. A\nformer trustee of the\nWashington Institute for\nNear East Policy, which has\nserved as a think tank for the\nAmerican Israeli Public\nAffairs Committee\n(AIPAC), a frontline\nlobbying group for Israel,\nChernick is said to be worth\n$750 million.\nChernick's fortune is puny\ncompared to that of the\nbillionaire Koch Brothers,\nextraction industry titans\nwho fund Tea Party-related\ngroups like Americans for\nProsperity, and it is dwarfed\nby the financial empire of\nHaim Saban, the Israeli-\nAmerican media baron who\nis one of the largest private\ndonors to the Democratic\nparty and recently matched\n$9 million raised for the\nFriends of the Israeli\nDefense Forces in a single\nnight. However, by injecting\nhis money into a small but\ninfluential constellation of\ngroups and individuals with\na narrow agenda, Chernick\nhas had a considerable\nimpact.\nThrough the Fairbrook\nFoundation, a private entity\nhe and his wife Joyce\ncontrol, Chernick has\nprovided funding to groupsranging from the Anti-\nDefamation League (ADL)\nand CAMERA, a right-\nwing, pro-Israel, media-\nwatchdog outfit, to violent\nIsraeli settlers living on\nPalestinian lands and figures\nlike the pseudo-academic\nauthor Robert Spencer, who\nis largely responsible for\npopularizing conspiracy\ntheories about the coming\nconquest of the West by\nMuslim fanatics seeking to\nestablish a worldwide\ncaliphate. Together, these\ngroups spread hysteria about\nMuslims into Middle\nAmerican communities\nwhere immigrants from the\nMiddle East have recently\nsettled, and they watched\nwith glee as likely\nRepublican presidential\nfrontrunners from Mike\nHuckabee to Sarah Palin\npromoted their cause and\nparroted their tropes.\nPerhaps the only thing more\nsurprising than the\nincreasingly widespread\nappeal of Islamophobia is\nthat, just a few years ago,\nthe phenomenon was\nconfined to a few college\ncampuses and an inner city\nneighborhood, and that it\nseemed like a fleeting fad\nthat would soon pass from\nthe American political\nlandscape.\nBirth of a Network\nThe Islamophobic crusade\nwas launched in earnest at\nthe peak of George W.\nBush's prestige when the\nneoconservatives and their\nallies were riding high. In\n2003, three years after the\ncollapse of President Bill\nClinton's attempt to resolvethe Israeli-Palestinian issue\nand in the immediate wake\nof the invasion of Iraq, a\nnetwork of Jewish groups,\nranging from ADL and the\nAmerican Jewish\nCommittee to AIPAC,\ngathered to address what\nthey saw as a sudden rise in\npro-Palestinian activism on\ncollege campuses\nnationwide. That meeting\ngave birth to the David\nProject, a campus advocacy\ngroup led by Charles Peters,\nwho had co-founded\nCAMERA, one of the many\noutfits bankrolled by\nChernick. With the help of\npublic relations\nprofessionals, Peters\nconceived a plan to \"take\nback the campus by\ninfluencing public opinion\nthrough lectures, the\nInternet, and coalitions,\" as\na memo produced at the\ntime by the consulting firm\nMcKinsey and Company\nstated.\nIn 2004, after conferring\nwith Martin Kramer, a\nfellow at the Washington\nInstitute for Near East\nPolicy, the pro-Israel think\ntank where Chernoff had\nserved as a trustee, Peters\nproduced a documentary\nfilm that he called Columbia\nUnbecoming. It was filled\nwith claims from Jewish\nstudents at Columbia\nUniversity claiming they\nhad endured intimidation\nand insults from Arab\nprofessors. The film\nportrayed that New York\nCity school's Department of\nMiddle East and Asian\nLanguages and Cultures as a\nhothouse of anti-Semitism.In their complaints, the\nstudents focused on one\nfigure in particular: Joseph\nMassad, a Palestinian\nprofessor of Middle East\nstudies. He was known for\nhis passionate advocacy of\nthe formation of a binational\nstate between Israel and\nPalestine, as well as for his\nstrident criticism of what he\ntermed \"the racist character\nof Israel.\" The film\nidentified him as \"one of the\nmost dangerous intellectuals\non campus,\" while he was\nfeatured as a crucial villain\nin The Professors: The 101\nMost Dangerous Academics\nin America, a book by the\n(Chernick-funded)\nneoconservative activist\nDavid Horowitz. As\nMassad was seeking tenure\nat the time, he was\nespecially vulnerable to this\nsort of wholesale assault.\nWhen the controversy over\nMassad's views intensified,\nCongressman Anthony\nWeiner, a liberal New York\nDemocrat who once\ndescribed himself as a\nrepresentative of \"the ZOA\n[Zionist Organization of\nAmerica] wing of the\nDemocratic Party,\"\ndemanded that Columbia\nPresident Lee Bollinger, a\nrenowned First Amendment\nscholar, fire the professor.\nBollinger responded by\nissuing uncharacteristically\ndefensive statements about\nthe \"limited\" nature of\nacademic freedom.\nIn the end, however, none of\nthe charges stuck. Indeed,\nthe testimonies in the David\nProject film were eventually\neither discredited or nevercorroborated. In 2009,\nMassad earned tenure after\nwinning Columbia's\nprestigious Lionel Trilling\nAward for excellence in\nscholarship.\nHaving demonstrated its\nability to intimidate faculty\nmembers and even powerful\nuniversity administrators,\nhowever, Kramer claimed a\nmoral victory in the name of\nhis project, boasting to the\npress that \"this is a turning\npoint.\" While the David\nProject subsequently\nfostered chapters on\ncampuses nationwide, its\ndirector set out on a\ndifferent path -- initially,\ninto the streets of Boston in\n2004 to oppose the\nconstruction of the Islamic\nSociety of Boston Cultural\nCenter.\nFor nearly 15 years, the\nIslamic Society of Boston\nhad sought to build the\ncenter in the heart of\nRoxbury, the city's largest\nblack neighborhood, to\nserve its sizable Muslim\npopulation. With\nendorsements from Mayor\nThomas Menino and leading\nMassachusetts lawmakers,\nthe mosque's construction\nseemed like a fait accompli -\nuntil, that is, the Rupert\nMurdoch-owned Boston\nHerald and his local Fox\nNews affiliate snapped into\naction. Boston Globe\ncolumnist Jeff Jacoby also\nchimed in with a series of\nreports claiming the center's\nplans were evidence of a\nSaudi Arabian plot to bolster\nthe influence of radical\nIslam in the United States,and possibly even to train\nunderground terror cells.\nIt was at this point that the\nDavid Project entered the\nfray, convening elements of\nthe local pro-Israel\ncommunity in the Boston\narea to seek strategies to\ntorpedo the project.\nAccording to emails\nobtained by the Islamic\nSociety's lawyers in a\nlawsuit against the David\nProject, the organizers\nsettled on a campaign of\nyears of nuisance lawsuits,\nalong with accusations that\nthe center had received\nforeign funding from \"the\nWahhabi movement in\nSaudi Arabia or... the\nMoslem Brotherhood.\"\nIn response, a grassroots\ncoalition of liberal Jews\ninitiated inter-faith efforts\naimed at ending a\ncontroversy that had\nessentially been\nmanufactured out of thin air\nand was corroding relations\nbetween the Jewish and\nMuslim communities in the\ncity. Peters would not,\nhowever, relent. \"We are\nmore concerned now than\nwe have ever been about a\nSaudi influence of local\nmosques,\" he announced at\na suburban Boston\nsynagogue in 2007.\nAfter paying out millions of\ndollars in legal bills and\nenduring countless smears,\nthe Islamic Society of\nBoston completed the\nconstruction of its\ncommunity center in 2008.\nMeanwhile, not surprisingly,\nnothing came of the David\nProject's dark warnings. As\nBoston-area National PublicRadio reporter Philip Martin\nreflected in September 2010,\n\"The horror stories that\npreceded [the center's]\ndevelopment seem shrill and\nhistrionic in retrospect.\"\nThe Network Expands\nThis second failed campaign\nwas, in the end, more about\nmovement building than\nsuccess, no less national\nsecurity. The local crusade\nestablished an effective\nblueprint for generating\nhysteria against the\nestablishment of Islamic\ncenters and mosques across\nthe country, while\ngalvanizing a cast of\ncharacters who would form\nan anti-Muslim network\nwhich would gain attention\nand success in the years to\ncome.\nIn 2007, these figures\ncoalesced into a proto-\nmovement that launched a\nnew crusade, this time\ntargeting the Khalil Gibran\nInternational Academy, a\nsecular Arabic-English\nelementary school in\nBrooklyn, New York.\nCalling their ad hoc pressure\ngroup, Stop the Madrassah\nmadrassah being simply\nthe Arab word for \"school\" -\nthe coalition's activists\nincluded an array of\npreviously unknown zealots\nwho made no attempt to\ndisguise their extreme views\nwhen it came to Islam as a\nreligion, as well as Muslims\nin America. Their stated\ngoal was to challenge the\nschool's establishment on\nthe basis of its violation of\nthe church-state separation\nin the U.S.\nConstitution. The true aimof the coalition, however,\nwas transparent: to pressure\nthe city's leadership to adopt\nan antagonistic posture\ntowards the local Muslim\ncommunity.\nThe activists zeroed in on\nthe school's principal,\nDebbie Almontaser, a\nveteran educator of Yemeni\ndescent, and baselessly\nbranded her \"a jihadist” as\nwell as a 9/11 denier. They\nalso accused her of as\nPamela Geller, a far-right\nblogger just then gaining\nprominence put it,\n\"whitewash[ing] the\ngenocide against the\nJews.\" Daniel Pipes, a\nneoconservative academic\npreviously active in the\ncampaigns against Joseph\nMassad and the Boston\nIslamic center (and whose\npro-Likud think tank,\nMiddle East Forum, has\nreceived $150,000 from\nChernick) claimed the\nschool should not go ahead\nbecause \"Arabic-language\ninstruction is inevitably\nladen with Pan-Arabist and\nIslamist baggage.\" As the\ncampaign reached a fever\npitch, Almontaser reported\nthat members of the\ncoalition were actually\nstalking her wherever she\nwent.\nGiven what Columbia\nJournalism School professor\nand former New York Times\nreporter Samuel Freedman\ncalled \"her clear, public\nrecord of interfaith activism\nand outreach,\" including\nwork with the New York\nPolice Department and the\nAnti-Defamation League\nafter the September 11thattacks, the assault on\nAlmontaser seemed little\nshort of bizarre -- until her\nassailants discovered a\nphotograph of a T-shirt\nproduced by AWAAM, a\nlocal Arab feminist\norganization, that read\n\"Intifada NYC.\" As it\nturned out, AWAAM\nsometimes shared office\nspace with a Yemeni-\nAmerican association on\nwhich Almontaser served as\na board member. Though\nthe connection seemed like a\nstretch, it promoted the line\nof attack the Stop the\nMadrassah coalition had\nbeen seeking.\nHaving found a way to\nwedge the emotional issue\nof the Israel-Palestine\nconflict into a previously\nNew York-centered\ncampaign, the school's\nopponents next gained a\nplatform at the Murdoch-\nowned New York Post,\nwhere reporters Chuck\nBennett and Jana Winter\nclaimed her T-shirt was\n\"apparently a call for a\nGaza-style uprising in the\nBig Apple.\" While\nAlmontaser attempted to\nexplain to the Post's\nreporters that she rejected\nterrorism, the Anti-\nDefamation League chimed\nin on cue. ADL spokesman\nOren Segal told the Post:\n\"The T-shirt is a reflection\nof a movement that\nincreasingly lauds violence\nagainst Israelis instead of\nrejecting it. That is\ndisturbing.\"\nBefore any Qassam rockets\ncould be launched from\nAlmontaser's school, herformer ally New York\nMayor Michael Bloomberg\ncaved to the growing\npressure and threatened to\nshut down the school,\nprompting her to resign. A\nJewish principal who spoke\nno Arabic replaced\nAlmontaser, who later filed\na lawsuit against the city for\nbreaching her free speech\nrights. In 2010, the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity\nCommission ruled that New\nYork's Department of\nEducation had \"succumbed\nto the very bias that the\ncreation of the school was\nintended to dispel\" by firing\nAlmontaser and urged it pay\nher $300,000 in damages.\nThe commission also\nconcluded that the Post had\nquoted her misleadingly.\nThough it failed to stop the\nestablishment of the Khalil\nGibran Academy, the\nburgeoning anti-Muslim\nmovement succeeded in\nforcing city leaders to bend\nto its will, and having\nlearned just how to do that,\nthen moved on in search of\nmore high-profile targets.\nAs the New York Times\nu at the time, \"The\nfight against the school...\nwas only an early skirmish\nin a broader, national\nstruggle.\"\n\"It's a battle that has really\njust begun.\" Pipes told the\nTimes.\nFrom Scam to Publicity\nCoup\nPipes couldn't have been\nmore on the mark. In late\n2009, the Islamophobes\nsprang into action again\nwhen the Cordoba Initiative,\na non-profit Muslim groupheaded by Feisai Abdul\nRauf, an exceedingly\nmoderate Suti Muslim imam\nwho regularly\nweied\nahmad representing the\nUnited States at the behest\nof the State Department,\nannounced that it was going\nto build a community center\nin downtown New York\nCity. With the help of\ninvestors, Rauf's Cordoba\nInitiative purchased space\ntwo blocks from Ground\nZero in Manhattan. The\nspace was to contain a\nprayer area as part of a large\ncommunity center that\nwould be open to everyone\nin the neighborhood.\nNone of these facts mattered\nto Pamela Geller. Thanks to\nconstant prodding at her\nblog, Atlas Shrugged, Geller\nmade Cordoba's\nconstruction plans a national\nissue, provoking fervent\ncalls from conservatives to\nprotect the \"hallowed\nground\" of 9/11 from\ncreeping Sharia. (That the\n\"mosque\" would have been\nout of sight of Ground Zero\nand that the neighborhood\nwas, in fact. od wah\neverything from strip clubs\nto fast-food joints didn't\nmatter.) Geller's activism\nagainst Cordoba House\nearned the 52-year-old full-\ntime blogger the attention\nshe apparently craved,\nincluding a\ncoin\nthe New York Times and\nfrequent cable news spots,\nespecially, of course, on Fox\nNews.\nMainstream reporters tended\nto focus on Geller's bizarre\nstunts. She posted a video\nof herselfin a string bikini on a Fort\nLauderdale beach, for\ninstance, while ranting about\n\"left-tards\" and \"Nazi\nHezbollah.\" Her call for\nboycotting Campbell's Soup\nbecause the company\noffered halal -- approved\nunder Islamic law (as kosher\nfood is under Jewish law)\nversions of its products got\nher much attention, as did\nher promotion of a screed\nclaiming that President\nBarack Obama was the\nillegitimate lovechild of\nMalcolm X.\nGeller had never earned a\nliving as a journalist. She\nsupported herself with\nmillions of dollars in a\ndivorce settlement and life\ninsurance money from her\nex-husband. He died in\n2008, a year after being\nindicted for an alleged $1.3\nmillion scam he was\naccused of running out of a\ncar dealership he co-owned\nwith Geller. Independently\nwealthy and with time on\nher hands, Geller proved\nable indeed when it came to\nexploiting her strange media\nstardom to incite the already\norganized political network\nof Islamophobes to intensify\ntheir crusade.\nShe also benefited from\nclose alliances with leading\nIslamophobes from Europe.\nAmong Geller's allies was\nAndrew Gravers, a Danish\nactivist who formed the\ngroup Stop the\nIslamicization of Europe,\nand gave it the unusually\nblunt motto: \"Racism is the\nlowest form of human\nstupidity, but Islamophobia\nis the height of commonsense.\" Gravers' group\ninspired Geller's own U.S.-\nbased outfit, Stop the\nIslamicization of America,\nwhich she formed with her\nfriend Robert Spencer, a\npseudo-scholar whose\nbestselling books, including\nThe Truth About\nMuhammad, Founder of the\nWorld's Most Intolerant\nReligion, prompted former\nadvisor to President Richard\nNixon and Muslim activist\nRobert Crane to call him,\n\"the principal leader... in\nthe new academic field of\nMuslim bashing.\"\n(According to the website\nPolitico, almost $1 million\nin donations from Chernick\nhas been steered to\nSpencer's Jihad Watch\ngroup through David\nHorowitz's Freedom\nCenter.)\nPerfect sources for\nRepublican political figures\nin search of the next hot-\nbutton cause, their rhetoric\nfound its way into the\ntalking points of Newt\nGingrich and Sarah Palin as\nthey propelled the crusade\nagainst Cordoba House into\nthe national spotlight.\nGingrich soon compared the\ncommunity center to a Nazi\nsign next to the Holocaust\nMemorial Museum, while\nPalin called it \"a stab in the\nheart\" of \"the Heartland.\"\nMeanwhile, Tea Party\ncandidates like Republican\nIlario Pantano, an Iraq war\nveteran who killed two\nunarmed Iraqi civilians,\nshooting them 60 times -- he\neven stopped to reload\nmade their opposition to\nCordoba House thecenterpiece of midterm\ncongressional campaigns\nconducted hundreds of miles\nfrom Ground Zero.\nGeller's campaign against\n\"the mosque at Ground\nZero\" gained an unexpected\nassist and a veneer of\nlegitimacy from established\nJewish leaders like Anti-\nDefamation League\nNational Director Abraham\nFoxman. \"Survivors of the\nHolocaust are entitled to\nfeelings that are irrational,\"\nhe remarked to the New\nYork Times. Comparing the\nbereaved family members of\n9-11 victims to Holocaust\nsurvivors, Foxman insisted,\n\"Their anguish entitles them\nto positions that others\nwould categorize as\nirrational or bigoted.\".\nSoon enough. David Harris,\ndirector of the (Chernick-\nfunded) American Jewish\nCommittee, was demanding\nthat Cordoba's leaders be\ncompelled to reveal their\n\"true attitudes\" about\nPalestinian militant groups\nbefore construction on the\ncenter was initiated. Rabbi\nMarvin Hier of the Simon\nWiesenthal Center of Los\nAngeles, another major\nJewish group, insisted it\nwould be \"insensitive\" for\nCordoba to build near \"a\ncemetery,\" though his\norganization had recently\nbeen granted permission\nfrom the municipality of\nJerusalem to build a\n\"museum of tolerance\" to be\ncalled The Center for\nHuman Dignity directly on\ntop of the Mamilla\nCemetery, a Muslim\ngraveyard that containedthousands of gravesites\ndating back 1,200 years.\nInspiration from Israel\nIt was evident from the\ninvolvement of figures like\nGravers that the\nIslamophobic network in the\nUnited States represented a\ntrans-Atlantic expansion of\nsimmering resentment in\nEurope. There, the far-right\nwas storming to victories in\nparliamentary elections\nacross the continent in part\nby appealing to the\nsimmering anti-Muslim\nsentiments of voters in rural\nand working-class\ncommunities. The extent of\nthe collaboration between\nEuropean and American\nIslamophobes has only\ncontinued to grow with\nGeller, Spencer, and even\nGingrich standing beside\nEurope's most prominent\nanti-Muslim figure, Dutch\nparliamentarian Geert\nWilders, at a rally against\nCordoba House. In the\nmeantime, Geller was\nissuing statements of\nsupport for the English\nDefense League, a band of\nunreconstructed neo-Nazis\nand former members of the\nwhites-only British National\nParty who intimidate\nMuslims in the streets of\ncities like Birmingham and\nLondon.\nIn addition, the trans-\nAtlantic Islamophobic\ncrusade has stretched into\nIsrael, a country that has\ncome to symbolize the\nnetwork's fight against the\nMuslim menace. As Geller\ntold the New York Times'\nAlan Feuer, Israel is \"a very\ngood guide because, like Isaid, in the war between the\ncivilized man and the\nsavage, you side with the\ncivilized man.\"\nEDL members regularly\nwave Israeli flags at their\nrallies, while Wilders claims\nto have formed his views\nabout Muslims during the\ntime he worked on an Israeli\ncooperative farm in the\n1980s. He has, he says,\nvisited the country more\nthan 40 times since to meet\nwith rightist political allies\nlike Aryeh Eldad, a member\nof the Israeli Knesset and\nleader of the far right\nHatikvah faction of the\nNational Union Party. He\nhas called for forcibly\n\"transferring\" the\nPalestinians living in Israel\nand the occupied West Bank\nto Jordan and Egypt. On\nDecember 5th, for example,\nWilders traveled to Israel for\na \"friendly\" meeting with\nForeign Minister Avigdor\nLieberman, then declared at\na press conference that\nIsrael should annex the West\nBank and set up a\nPalestinian state in Jordan.\nIn the apocalyptic clash of\ncivilizations the global anti-\nMuslim network has sought\nto incite, tiny armed Jewish\nsettlements like Yitzar,\nlocated on the hills above\nthe occupied Palestinian city\nof Nablus, represent front-\nline fortresses. Inside\nYitzar's state-funded\nyeshiva, a rabbi named\nYitzhak Shapira has\ninstructed students in what\nrules must be applied when\nconsidering killing non-\nJews. Shapira summarized\nhis opinions in a widelypublicized book, Torat\nHaMelech, or The King's\nTorah. Claiming that non-\nJews are \"uncompassionate\nby nature,\" Shapira cited\nrabbinical texts to declare\nthat gentiles could be killed\nin order to \"curb their evil\ninclinations.\" \"There is\njustification,\" the rabbi\nproclaimed, \"for killing\nbabies if it is clear that they\nwill grow up to harm us, and\nin such a situation they may\nbe harmed deliberately, and\nnot only during combat with\nadults.\"\nIn 2006, the rabbi was\nbriefly held by Israeli police\nfor urging his supporters to\nmurder all Palestinians over\nthe age of 13. Two years\nlater, according to the Israeli\nnewspaper Haaretz, he\nsigned a rabbinical letter in\nsupport of Israeli Jews who\nhad brutally assaulted two\nArab youths on the country's\nHolocaust Remembrance\nDay. That same year,\nShapira was arrested as a\nsuspect in helping\nonthestate a rocket attack\nagainst a Palestinian village\nnear Nablus.\nThough he was not charged,\nhis name came up again in\nconnection with another act\nof terror when, in January\n2010, the Israeli police\nraided his settlement\nseeking vandals who had set\nfire to a nearby mosque.\nOne of Shapira's followers,\nan American immigrant,\nJack Teitel, has confessed to\nmurdering two innocent\nPalestinians and attempting\nto the kill the liberal Israeli\nhistorian Ze'ev Sternhell\nwith a mail bomb.What does all this have to\ndo with Islamophobic\ncampaigns in the United\nStates? A great deal,\nactually. Through New\nYork-based tax-exempt non-\nprofits like the Central Fund\nof israel and Ateret\nCohenim, for instance, the\nomnipresent Aubrey\nChernick has sent tens of\nthousands of dollars to\nsupport the Yitzar\nsettlement, as well as to the\nmessianic settlers dedicated\nto \"Judaizing\" East\nJerusalem. The settlement\nmovement's leading online\nnews magazine, Arutz\nSheva, has featured Geller\nas a columnist. A friend of\nGeller's, Beth Gilinsky, a\nright-wing activist with a\ngroup called the Coalition to\nHonor Ground Zero and the\nfounder of the Jewish\nAction Alliance (apparently\nrun out of a Manhattan real\noffice), organized a\nlarge rally in New York City\nin April 2010 to protest the\nObama administration's call\nfor a settlement freeze.\nAmong Chernick's major\nfunding recipients is a\nsupposedly \"apolitical\"\ngroup called Aish Hatorah\nthat claims to educate Jews\nabout their heritage. Based\nin New York and active in\nthe fever swamps of\nnorthern West Bank\nsettlements near Yitzar,\nAish Hatorah shares an\naddress and staff with a\nshadowy foreign non-profit\ncalled the Clarion Fund.\nDuring the 2008 U.S.\nelection campaign, the\nClarion Fund distributed 28\nmillion DVDs of apropaganda film called\nObsession as newspaper\ninserts to residents of swing\nstates around the country.\nThe film featured a who's\nwho of anti-Muslim\nactivists, including Walid\nShoebat, a self-proclaimed\n\"former PLO terrorist.\"\nAmong Shoebat's more\nstriking statements: \"A\nsecular dogma like Nazism\nis less dangerous than is\nIslamofascism today.\" At a\nChristian gathering in 2007,\nthis \"former Islamic\nterrorist\" told the crowd that\nIslam was a \"satanic cult\"\nand that he had been born\nagain as an evangelical\nChristian. In 2008, however,\nthe Jerusalem Post, a right-\nleaning newspaper, exposed\nhim as a fraud, whose\nclaims to terrorism were\nfictional.\nIslamophobic groups\nregistered only a minimal\nimpact during the 2008\nelection campaign. Two\nyears later, however, after\nthe Republicans regained\ncontrol of the House of\nRepresentatives in midterm\nelections, the network\nappears to have reached\ncritical mass. Of course, the\ndeciding factor in the\nelection was the economy,\nand in two years, Americans\nwill likely vote their\npocketbooks again. But that\nthe construction of a single\nIslamic community center or\nthe imaginary threat of\nSharia law were issues at all\nreflected the influence of a\nsmall band of locally\noriented activists, and\nsuggested that when a\ncertain presidentialcandidate who has already\nbeen demonized as a crypto-\nMuslim runs for reelection,\nthe country's most vocal\nIslamophobes could once\nagain find a national\nplatform amid the frenzied\natmosphere of the campaign.\nBy now, the Islamophobic\ncrusade has gone beyond the\nright-wing pro-Israel\nactivists, cyber-bigots, and\nambitious hucksters who\nconceived it. It now belongs\nto leading Republican\npresidential candidates, top-\nrated cable news hosts, and\ncrowds of Tea Party\nactivists. As the fervor\nspreads, the crusaders are\nbasking in the glory of what\nthey accomplished. \"I didn't\nchoose this moment,\" Geller\nmused to the New York\nTimes, \"this moment chose\nme.\"\nMax Blumenthal is an\naward-winning journalist\nwhose work has appeared in\nthe New York Times, the\nLos Angeles Times, the\nDaily Beast, the Nation, the\nHuffington Post, the\nIndependent Film Channel.\nSalon.com, Al Jazeera\nEnglish, and other\npublications.

    "text": "GAZA (Reuters) - Israel carried out a series of air strikes in the Gaza Strip, Palestinian Authority officials and\nwitnesses said, after militants from the Hamas-ruled territory fired rockets into southern Israel. No one was\nreported killed in any of the attacks. The Israeli strikes targeted a Hamas training camp, where two gunmen\nwere wounded, smuggling tunnels along Gaza's border with Egypt, and other, unpopulated areas, Hamas\nofficials and witnesses said. An Israeli military spokeswoman, who was checking that report, said 13 rockets\nwere fired from Gaza into Israel in the past two days. None of the attacks caused any injuries. Hamas leaders\nhave tried to curb rocket fire at Israel, but smaller groups continue to carry out such attacks. Israel's military\nsaid more than 200 cross-border missiles, rockets and mortars have been fired from Gaza this year. An air strike\nin Gaza on December 18 killed five militants from a rocket launching squad.",

KRISTOF\\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/nicholasdkristof/index.html?inline=nyt-\\nper>\\n\\nWe face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that\\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.\\n\\nIt's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:\\n\\n• The United States spends nearly as much on military power\\n<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trends> as every other country in the world combined,\\naccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much\\n<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trendgraphs/Top10bubble/top10bubble2009/image_vi\\new_fullscreen> as the country with the next highest budget, China.\\n\\n• The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world\\nwar that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?\\n\\n• The intelligence community is so vast that more people have \"top secret\" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n• The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year\\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/opinion/29kristof.html>, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the\\nRevolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War\\ncombined.\\n\\nThis is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions,\\nrequested about 6 percent <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23budget.html?_r=3> more for the\\nmilitary this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.\\n\\n\"Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose\\nvotes,\" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. He is author of a\\nthoughtful recent book, \"Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War.\"\\n\\nThe costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His\\nson, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.\\n\\nLet me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that\\nwe need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military toois alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper\\ndiplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign\\nservice - and that's preposterous.\\n\\nWhat's more, if you're carrying an armioad of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power\\noften isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path.\\nIndeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.\\n\\nAfter the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance\\nAmerican security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S.\\nIn other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our\\nmoney have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?\\n\\nParadoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in\\narms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: \"Every gun that is made, every warship\\nlaunched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are\\ncold and are not clothed.\" And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that\\nmilitary spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has\\nargued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.\\n\\nAmerican troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see\\nfirsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one\\nAmerican soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.\\n\\nThere are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for\\narmaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial\\ndiplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.\\n\\n\"Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,\" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great\\ndocument, but we'll see if it can be implemented - especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the\\nState Department budget.\\n\\nThey should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing\\nresearch against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community\\ncolleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.\\n\\nAs we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a\\nmilitary base in Germany.\\nI invite you to comment on this column on my blog, On the Ground <http://www.nytimes.com/ontheground>.

    "text": "Keith Richards Has Memories to Burn\n\nBy JANET MASLIN\n\nIt is 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time in the New York office of Keith Richards's manager, a place that might look ordinary if\nevery wall and shelf were not crammed with some of the world's most glorious rock 'n' roll memorabilia. Mr. Richards has\na 3 o'clock appointment. \"Come on in, he'll be here in a minute,\" an assistant says and here he comes in a minute, at\n3:01. This from a man who once prided himself for operating on Keith Time, as in: the security staff ate the shepherd's pie\nthat Keith wanted in his dressing room? Then everyone in this packed stadium can bloody well wait. The Rolling Stones\ndon't play until another shepherd's pie shows up.\n\nChalk up the promptness to the man's new incarnation: he is now Keith Richards, distinguished author. True, he is far\nfrom the only rock star to turn memoirist, and far from the only Rolling Stone to write a book about himself - very much\nabout himself. The raven-haired Ron Wood wrote \"Ronnie,\" in which he described Brian Jones as \"me in a blond wig.\" Bill\nWyman, the band's retired bass player and bean counter, wrote \"Stone Alone,\" in which not a 15-shilling demo disc went\nunmentioned. Now Mr. Richards has written the keeper: \"Life,\" a big, fierce, game-changing account of the Stones' nearly\nhalf-century-long adventure.\n\n\"It's the most difficult thing I've ever done,” he says about the book. \"I'd rather make 10 records.\"\n\nBut he sounds anything but weary. And he seems refreshed, bearing surprisingly little resemblance to the battered, kohl-\neyed pirate Keith Richards who looks like 50 miles of bad road. Today, in neutral street clothes and hot-green shoes, he is\npositively debonair. On his hands: the ubiquitous silver skull ring, swollen knuckles, the thin white scar from a hunk of\nsteaming phosphorus that burned his finger to the bone while he played through a concert without stopping. On his head:\nboth a headband and a raffish, straw-colored hat, gray tufts poking out in all directions. Not a single gewgaw hangs off it.\n\"I've been through that phase,\" he says. \"Don't know that the hair will take the pressure anymore.\"\n\nHe's been through quite a lot of phases. And they're all on the page in \"Life”: the Boy Scout (really); the tyro rocker; the\nlovestruck kid (mad for Ronnie Spector, unbeknownst to Phil Spector); the astonished new star; the heroin-addicted older\none; the jaded veteran of countless world tours; and the longtime sparring partner of Mick Jagger. (Despite tabloid shock\nover the bickering in the book, these two have seriously been calling each other names at least since the early 1980s.) All of\nthis is recounted with straight-up candor, and some of it is easily sensationalized. But the book's single biggest stunner is a\nhand-written note on its jacket flap: \"Believe it or not, I haven't forgotten any of it.\"\n\nHow, he is asked, is this humanly possible from a man as well known for stupefaction as \"Satisfaction?\" \"I think my main\nconcern at the beginning was whether my memory was really reliable,” he says. \"Fox had to do a little sleuthing.\" Fox is\nJames Fox, the journalist and author of \"White Mischief,\" who has been Mr. Richards's friend over many years and was\nhis collaborator in putting \"Life\" together. (It was sold to Little, Brown & Company for a reported advance of more than $7\nmillion.)\n\nMr. Fox wound up researching Mr. Richards's past, conducting interviews with those who knew him long ago and drawing\nupon wonderfully candid old letters and journal entries. \"Spent day practising,\" the 19-year-old Mr. Richards wrote in\nJanuary 1963, when the Stones were just beginning to play in public. \"Worthwhile, I hope!\" Also exhumed: a 1962 letter\nfrom Mr. Richards to his Aunt Patty describing a boy he had known in primary school, Mick Jagger. He signs off\n\"Luff/Keith xxXXX\"\n\nThese artifacts turned out to be the Richards equivalent of Proust's madeleines, though Mr. Richards, whose reading taste\nruns to naval history and the novels of Patrick O'Brian and George MacDonald Fraser, would hardly put it that way. In any\ncase they prompted recollections that he never expected to rediscover, and \"Life\" began to click. Once his stories were told\nand a draft was written, he and Mr. Fox wound up sitting together with separate copies of the manuscript as Mr. Fox read\n\nthe whole book aloud. \"What I couldn't guess was that he'd be such a very good natural editor,\" Mr. Fox, reached by e-\nmail, says of Mr. Richards. \"He cut, accordingly, for pace and rhythm a real musical cut.\"\n\nAs for calling the book \"Life,\" Mr. Richards did some editing there too. \"My Life\" was what the book was to be called. \"I\nsaid 'I tell you what, just cut off the 'My,' and you've got a title,\" he says. He might just as appropriately have used another\ntitle he likes, \"Keep It Dark.\" But, he says, \"I'm saving it for a song.\"\n\nThe contents of \"Life\" are dark enough already. The book begins with a 1975 drug bust in Arkansas and a judge who was\npersuaded to free Mr. Richards after confiscating his hunting knife (which still hangs in the courtroom) and having a\npicture taken with him. How did Mr. Richards get so lucky? \"I really can't explain it,\" he says, deadpan, about that now.\n\"Maybe I've got an honest face.\"\n\nIt covers many other arrests too, as well as Mr. Richards's grueling efforts to kick his heroin addiction, which he claims to\nhave done successfully 30 years ago. \"Stories like this aren't told very much,\" he insists. \"There aren't many people willing\nto tell them.\"\n\nThen there are the other health hazards that the book describes. Like electrocution. \"My most spectacular one was in\nSacramento. ...\" he now says with a smile, drifting off into a fond-sounding reverie that involves a guitar string touching an\nungrounded microphone and clouds of smoke billowing out of his mouth. He has a good laugh at the memory of finding\nhimself in a hospital and hearing a doctor say, \"Well, they either wake up or they don't.\"\n\n\"Life\" has already attracted undue attention for a schoolyard-sounding anatomical swipe at Mr. Jagger. But this is a book\nthat pulls no punches, and most of its disses are more serious than that. “Cold-blooded\" and \"vicious\" are only two of the\nmore printable words he uses to describe Brian Jones. Allen Ginsberg was an \"old gasbag.\" Mick Taylor, the former\nRolling Stone, \"didn't do anything\" after he left the band, and Donald Cammell, the film director (\"Performance,\" starring\nMr. Jagger and Anita Pallenberg, Mr. Richards's longtime lover and partner in crime), couldn't commit suicide quickly\nenough to suit Mr. Richards. (He shot himself in 1996.) When Marlon Brando propositioned him and Ms. Pallenberg, Mr.\nRichards remembers replying with this: \"Later, pal.\"\n\nAs for Mr. Jagger, the complaints are deep-seated. They involve credit hogging, social climbing, egomania, insecurity,\nunethical business behavior and - here comes a Freudian's holiday for anyone who's ever watched the bare-chested young\nJagger and Richards vamp it up together - uncertain sexual identity. There's also a cool condescension about Mr. Jagger's\ncontributions to the duo's songwriting. And a nasty nickname or two, like \"Disco Boy.\"\n\nIn conversation about all this, Mr. Richards is emphatically blasé: \"It's bound to be somewhat rough, but the point is I'm\ntrying to tell the story from Day 1 to now,\" he says. And sure: \"There's the odd conflict here and there. But if you weigh it\nall out, those things count for nothing.\" Mr. Richards did see to it that Mr. Jagger knew what was in the book ahead of\ntime. \"The important thing to me,\" he says, \"was that Mick had been through it and seen it and knew what was what.\" And\nis there anything that one Stone can say about another Stone and really give offense at this point? \"No.\"\n\nBut is there anything new that can be said about the Stones anyway? As \"Life\" emphatically demonstrates, the answer is\nyes. And some of its most surprisingly revelatory material appears in what Mr. Richards jokingly calls \"Keef's Guitar\nWorkshop.\" Here are the secrets of some of the world's most famous rock riffs and the almost toy-level equipment on\nwhich they were recorded, like the cassette recorder onto which Mr. Richards dubbed guitar layer after guitar layer for\n\"Street Fighting Man,\" \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\" and part of \"Gimme Shelter.\" Here's how the silent beats in Elvis Presley's\n\"Heartbreak Hotel\" worked their way into some of Mr. Richards's most inspired solos. Mr. Fox found that \"Heartbreak\nHotel\" itself was the key to some of Mr. Richards's best musical memories.\n\nSome of this is by now well known to music critics. But Mr. Richards makes it fascinating at the layman's level. And he is\nsurprised to find that early readers haven't been skipping the musicology, even though the book cordially invites them to\ndo so. What he finds most gratifying about having written \"Life\" is the chance for both him and his readers to grasp the\nbreadth and range of this book's material. He is the rare memoirist who can say, without hyperbole, “that what I hoped\nwas worth sharing with people turned out to be far more important than I could possibly imagine.”\n\nIt's getting late. Time to leave this bright orange room where Mr. Richards's name is emblazoned on a director's chair;\nwhere assorted music awards and platinum records are everywhere; where there's a discreet little skull in the middle of\nthe wall mirror; where his Louis Vuitton guitar case he did an ad for Vuitton - is parked in a corner. But the items\nlikeliest to catch his eye are the ones on the coffee table: loose cigarettes neatly arrayed in a holder, a lighter, more\ncigarettes in a pack.\n\n\"Do you mind if I smoke?\" he had asked when he first appeared. Easy one: Who, aside from Keith Richards and certain\nlegal authorities, has ever kept Keith Richards from doing anything? But an hour has gone by, and he hasn't touched the\ncigarettes. He hasn't even looked at them. He has done not one thing to make him resemble the sullen, haunted,\ndiabolically beautiful creature on the cover of his book, the one with hellfire blazing up from his hand to meet the blurry\nwhite thing he's smoking.\n\n\"That?” he says innocently when asked about the picture. \"Oh, that's just me lighting a cigarette. That's all I was doing.\"",

But within a few months of being sworn in, the President and his top aides were sitting\ndown with leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to hash out a deal that they thought would make health care\nreform possible.\nOver the following months, pharmaceutical industry lobbyists and executives met with top White House aides dozens of\ntimes to hammer out a deal that would secure industry support for the administration's health care reform agenda in\nexchange for the White House abandoning key elements of the president's promises to reform the pharmaceutical\nindustry. They flooded Congress with campaign contributions, and hired dozens of former Capitol Hill insiders to push\ntheir case. How they did it--pieced together from news accounts, disclosure forms including lobbying reports and\nFederal Election Commission records, White House visitor logs and the schedule Sen. Max Baucus releases voluntarily\n<http://wiki.opencongress.org/wiki/Max_Baucus/Schedule> --is a testament to how ingrained the grip of special\ninterests remains in Washington.\n\nIn the 2008 campaign, Obama declared his intention to include all stakeholders as he sought to reform the nation's\nhealth care system, but also supported key Democratic health reform policies\n<http://www.barackobama.com/2007/06/16/obarna_says_drug_plan_could_sav.php>. Among these were several that\ntargeted the pharmaceutical industry: Allowing re-importation of drugs from first world countries with lower drug prices\nand providing Medicare with negotiating authority over prescription drug prices in the recently enacted Part D program.\nThese weren't just promises, Obama had already voted for both of them as a senator in 2007. (Roll Call Vote 132\n<http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00132>\nand Roll Call Vote 150\n<http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00150>.)\nSet to carry out this agenda were two Capitol Hill veterans, schooled in the monied Washington culture, chief of staff\nRahm Emanuel <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/16/us/politics/16emanuel.html?_r=1> and deputy chief of staff Jim\nMessina <http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/20/AR2009022003853.html>. Emanuel\nwas a former fundraiser, Clinton administration official, investment banker and member of the Democratic leadership in\nCongress. Messina was the former campaign manager and chief of staff to the powerful Senate Finance Committee\nchairman Max Baucus. Both were known for their unparalleled legislative abilities.\nBecause of Obama's decision to develop a plan operating through the legislative process, members of Congress also\nplayed key roles. Early on, the pharmaceutical companies were told to deal directly with Senate Finance Committee\nchairman Max Baucus <http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/health/policy/06insure.html>. Baucus would be the\nvehicle for the deal worked out behind the scenes by the White House and PhRMA.\nCentral to this effort was PhRMA president, CEO and top lobbyist Billy Tauzin, a longtime Democratic member of\nCongress who switched party affiliations after Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994. By switching parties\nTauzin was able to maintain his influence and even rose to be Chairman of the House Committee on Energy &\nCommerce. Tauzin became the poster child of Washington's mercenary culture. He crafted a bill to provide prescription\ndrug access to Medicare recipients, one that provided major concessions to the pharmaceutical industry. Medicare\nwould not be able to negotiate for lower prescription drug costs and reimportation of drugs from first world countries\nwould not be allowed. A few months after the bill passed, Tauzin announced that he was retiring from Congress and\nwould be taking a job helming PhRMA for a salary of $2 million.\nTauzin's job change became fodder for a campaign ad that then presidential candidate Barack Obama ran in the spring\nof 2008 simply titled \"Billy <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCRO0g9CfAw>.\" It featured the candidate, sleeves\nrolled up, talking to a salon of gasping Americans about the ways of Washington. \"The pharmaceutical industry wrote\ninto the prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug companies. And you know what, the\nchairman of the committee, who pushed the law through, went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making $2\nmillion a year.\" The screen fades to black to inform the viewer that, \"Barack Obama is the only candidate who refuses\nWashington lobbyist money,\" while the candidate continues his lecture, \"Imagine that. That's an example of the same\nold game playing in Washington. You know, I don't want to learn how to play the game better, I want to put an end to\nthe game playing.\"\nAiding PhRMA in their outreach to Congress would be a squadron of lobbyists to push their health care reform priorities.\nOver the course of 2009, the drug industry trade group spent over $28 million\n<http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?Iname=Pharmaceutical+Rsrch+%26+Mfrs+of+America&year=2009>\non in house and hired lobbyists. Aside from PhRMA's massive in-house lobbying operation, the trade group hired 48\noutside lobbying firms. The total number of lobbyists working for PhRMA in 2009 reached 165. Some 137 of those 165\nlobbyists representing PhRMA were former employees of either the legislative or executive branches. Of these dozens\nwere former congressional staffers including two former chiefs of staff to Max Baucus.\nAccording to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, drug makers contributed huge sums to congressional\ncampaign committees <http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=H04> during the same period--from\nJanuary to the end of October (4th quarter numbers are still being totaled), industry political action committees,\nemployees and their family members flooded lawmakers with over $8 million. Those contributions tilted heavily to\nDemocrats over Republicans by a 57 to 42 percent margin--the first time in any election cycle going back to 1990, the\nfirst year that the Center for Responsive Politics began tracking industry giving, that Democrats were so favored. Given\ntheir majorities on Capitol Hill, and the new President's intention to reform America's health care system, the new tilt\nwas perhaps not surprising.\n***\nOn March 5, the White House held a meeting with major health care industry leaders\n<http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/health/jan-june09/healthcare_03-05.html> to try to bring them to the table\nand see what could be done to gain their support. In attendance were Billy Tauzin, president, CEO and top lobbyist for\nPhRMA, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler, America's Health Care Plans (AHIP) Chairman Karen Ignani, Tom Donohue of the\nChamber of Commerce and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations' Risa Lavizzomourey. A day before the White House\nmeeting Tauzin appeared on CNBC\n<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas_top_lobbyist_said_what.php> touting health care reform and\npromising to work closely with the Obama administration. In the interview he touted it as an \"optimistic plan\",\nacknowledging that the industry did have a few problems but\nwas glad to have a chance to discuss these. Some were\n<http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/03/big_pharmas__top_lobbyist_said_what.php> caught dumb-founded\n<http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjQxZjZhYTc0ZjM2MDAxMjQ1NDY4NzNhZWEzNjg3YmM=http://corner.nat\nionalreview.com/post/?q=NjQxZjZhYTc0ZjM2MDAxMjQ1NDY4NzNhZWEzNjg3YmM=> by this apparent change of heart\non behalf of an industry long adverse to health care reforms.\nOn April 15, Jim Messina and Jon Selib, chief of staff to Senate Finance Committee chairman Max Baucus, convened a\nmeeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) with leaders of organized labor\nand health care groups, including PhRMA. At the meeting, the groups decided to form two nonprofit entities to promote\nreform efforts, Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable Quality Care, that would be almost entirely funded by\nPhRMA <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28362.html>. The two groups spent $24 million on their\nadvertising campaigns; the contract to produce and place ads went to White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod's\nformer firm <http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26240.html>, AKPD, which owed Axelrod $2 million.\nIn the next month, CEO's from pharmaceutical companies would meet with Baucus and administration officials at least\nfour times. These talks preceded a major public event at the White House, one critical to its strategy to promote health\ncare reform. On May 11, PhRMA and other trade industry groups pledged cost cutting measures\n<http://cnnmoney.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?action=cpt&title=Health+care+groups+propose+$2+trillion+in+cost+\ncontrols+-+May.+11,+2009&expire=-\n1&urlID=403007811&fb=Y&url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/05/11/news/economy/healthcare_reformproposals/index.\nhtm&partnerID=2200> to the White House that would save, they claimed, upwards of $2 trillion over the next decade.\nPresident Obama announced the deal in the State Dining Room, flanked by leaders of the various trade groups; the\nadministration followed up with a media blitz in the press and on the White House Web site\n<http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/Coming-Together-Bringing-Down-Costs/> .\nThe next day, Healthy Economy Now's PhRMA funded ad campaign ran their first advertisement\n<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0KuoAV6yt0> in support of the health care reform process calling for the\ngovernment to finally \"fix\" the nation's health care cost problems. While many elements of the $2 trillion cost cutting\npledge fell apart, the drug industry remained committed to the process in the hopes that they could ultimately win out\nand defeat the provisions they most feared in closed-door meetings with the White House.\nThe first occurred on June 2. White House visitor logs show PhRMA's top executives, including Tauzin, and industry CEOs\nmet with Sarah Fenn from the White House Office of Health Care Reform. On the same day, the publicly available\nschedule of Senator Max Baucus shows Tauzin and the same industry CEOs met the Senate Finance Committee\nchairman. What ultimately resulted from these coordinated meetings would be revealed by Baucus on June 20.\nIn a press release <http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2009press/prb062009.pdf> featuring a statement by Tauzin,\nBaucus revealed that the pharmaceutical industry had accepted $80 billion in cost cutting measures to be included in the\nSenate Finance Committee version of the bill. According to news reports\n<http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD18F267-18FE-70B2-A8F59600260227DF>, Baucus initially proposed\n$100 billion in cost cutting measures, but the executives and lobbyists meeting on June 2 were able to win the lower\nfigure.\nThe terms of the initial cost-cutting deal included $30 billion go directly towards closing the \"donut hole\" in Medicare\nprescription drug coverage. The \"donut hole\" is a term for the gap in coverage that occurs within the Medicare\nprescription drug coverage. For those purchasing prescription drugs through the Medicare program coverage cuts off at\n$2,700 spent and does not pick back up again until $6,154 is spent by the participant. The amount proposed in the deal,\n50 percent coverage for drugs within the coverage gap, however, would not completely close the \"donut hole.\"\nIn Baucus' press release, Tauzin is quoted as saying, \"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and, working together, we\ncan make this hope for a better tomorrow a reality today.\" This \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunity also extended to the\npharmaceutical industry's ability to blunt the long-term Democratic agenda of lowering prescription drug prices through\nMedicare negotiations, re-importation and quicker release of generics onto the market. After making such a grand\nstatement of support through cost cutting proposals it was time for the pharmaceutical industry to finally force the\nWhite House and Democrats to take certain chips off the table.\nBaucus proceeded with a plan to convene a bipartisan group\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/us/politics/28baucus.html> in an effort to craft the bill desired by the White\nHouse. These participants included Democrats Kent Conrad and Jeff Bingaman and Republicans Chuck Grassley, Mike\nEnzi and Olympia Snowe. Baucus' decision and the need to solidify deals with groups like the pharmaceutical industry -\nwhich were reliant on Baucus producing a bill - slowed down the legislative process making it impossible for Congress to\nmeet the White House's announced August recess deadline <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/21/obama-\ndefends-august-dead_n_241755.html> for passing health care reform.\nSoon after, PhRMA's big guns and industry lobbyists paid the White House another visit on July 7 and this time met with\nRahm Emanuel and Jim Messina (Baucus' chief of staff Jon Selib is also listed in White House visitor logs for this\nmeeting). In August, The Huffington Post's <http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/13/internal-memo-confirms-\nbi_n_258285.html> Ryan Grim reported on an internal memo that was drafted at that meeting that outlined the policies\nthat would not be allowed into any final version of health care reform. These included Medicare prescription drug\nnegotiations, drug re-importation, and the lowering of prices for drugs available through Medicare Part D and Part B.\nThe deal would be $80 billion in cost cutting and absolutely no more.\n***\nWhile the $80 billion deal was cut with Baucus' committee, other congressional committees continued to mark-up their\nown versions of health care reform without the knowledge that the White House was relying on Baucus to produce the\nfinal product. In the House of Representatives, the House Energy & Cornmerce Committee leveled a direct threat to the\n$80 billion deal. Energy & Commerce Chair Henry Waxman sought to include all of the provisions that PhRMA had\ngotten the White House and Baucus to cut out of the reform bill. These included drug reimportation, Medicare\nnegotiating power and speedier release of generics to the market. According to previous analysis of the measures\nproposed by the committee, these measures would have totaled hundreds of billions in cost cuts, far exceeding the $80\nbillion cap agreed to by the White House, Baucus and PhRMA.\nThe cost cutting measures passed in the Energy & Commerce bill spooked the board of PhRMA, which included all of the\nCEOs involved in the deal-cutting meetings with the White House and Baucus. The board pressured Tauzin to go public\nwith the deal to ensure that the White House would recognize it and not renege. On August 4, the Los Angeles Times\n<http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/04/nation/na-healthcare-pharma4>, in an exclusive report, featured quotes\nfrom Tauzin claiming that a deal between the White House and PhRMA existed and that, as Tauzin put it, \"The White\nHouse blessed it.\" Tom Hamburger wrote in the article, \"For his part, Tauzin said he had not only received the White\nHouse pledge to forswear Medicare drug price bargaining, but also a separate promise not to pursue another proposal\nObama supported during the campaign: importing cheaper drugs from Canada or Europe.\"\nThe White House's Jim Messina later confirmed Tauzin's claim, stating, \"The president encouraged this approach ... He\nwanted to bring all the parties to the table to discuss health insurance reform.\"\nDemocratic lawmakers were furious. Rep. Raul Grijalva, chairman of the Progressive Caucus, asked\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/06/nealth/policy/06insure.html>, \"Are industry groups going to be the ones at the\ntable who get the first big piece of the pie and we just fight over the crust?\"\n***\nOn September 7, Baucus' bill made a private circulation on the Hill; pharmaceutical industry cost-cutting did not exceed\n$80 billion. Five days later, the New York Times <http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/12/drug-makers-plan-\nto-back-baucus-plan-with-ad-dollars/> reported that PhRMA planned to spend up to $150 million in an advertising blitz\nin support of Baucus' bill. The Times noted that the ad spending \"...would be a follow-up to the deal that drug makers\nstruck in June with Mr. Baucus and the White House.\" On September 16, Baucus released the full text of his legislation\n<http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/09/16/health-care-bill-baucus-s_n_288218.html> to the public.\nThe White House, PhRMA and Baucus still had to fight a few battles to keep the deal intact. The key amendment\ntargeting the PhRMA deal in committee mark-up came from Sen. Bill Nelson from Florida, which has one of the largest\nMedicare participant populations in the nation. The pull of constituent needs clearly put Bill Nelson into a position to\npush for further cost cutting in Medicare prescription drug pricing. His target: closing the \"donut hole\" completely.\nNelson claimed that his amendment would generate $106 billion in revenue\n<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Nelson_PhRMA_amendment_fails.html>, or from PhRMA's perspective\nincrease their cost-cutting to $186 billion. That would be unacceptable to PhRMA, to Baucus, to the White House and to\nthe pharmaceutical industry who had made the deal. Other Senate Democrats, Tom Carper and Robert Menendez voted\nwith Republicans and Baucus on the committee to defeat the amendment\n<http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/sep/24/panel-fails-overturn-white-house-deal-drugmakers/>. It is little\nsurprise the Carper's Delaware is home to AstraZeneca and Menendez' New Jersey is home to Merck and Bristol-Myers-\nSquibb, all of which lobbied for the $80 billion cap.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid introduced the final bill, with the cap in place, on November 19. Debate began on\nDec. 3, and with it come one more attempt by members to change the terms of the deal. Senator Byron Dorgan\nintroduced an amendment that would allow for drug re-importation, but as the date for voting drew near, the Federal\nDrug Administration (FDA) released a letter <http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/71307-fda-opposes-senate-drug-\nimportation-amendmen> objecting to the proposal that echoed pharmaceutical industry talking points: \"...as currently\nwritten, the resulting structure would be logistically challenging to implement and resource intensive. In addition, there\nare significant safety concerns.\" Dorgan's amendment was defeated\n<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/1209/BREAKING_Senate_rejects_Dorgan_amendment.html> with numerous\nDemocrats previously in support of reimportation switching to \"no\" votes.\nOn Christmas Eve, the bill passed the Senate with the PhRMA deal fully intact.\n***\nNew Year's Eve passed with no further action on health care reform. Public opinion regarding the health care reform bill\nhad been slipping throughout 2009. It reached a fulcrum in the special election to replace the deceased senator Ted\nKennedy in Massachusetts on January 19, 2010. Newly minted senator Scott Brown campaigned that he would be the\nsenator to provide Republicans with the votes to filibuster the final health care reform bill. Democrats ran for cover.\nDespite having the largest majorities of any party since the 1970s, Democrats put the brakes on their agenda,\nparticularly health care reform.\nIn the end, the pharmaceutical industry's support for health care reform will be left up in the air. After spending $100\nmillion in advertising in support of legislation that Tauzin and key executives hoped would be a windfall for the\npharmaceutical industry, the legislative process had flat-lined. In February, the board of PhRMA, split over the deal cut\nby Tauzin, pushed Tauzin to resign his post <http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/health-reform-in-limbo-\ntop-drug-lobbyist-quits/?partner=rss&emc=rss>.\nIn an interview with Diane Sawyer\n<http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0110/Obama_concedes_talks_raised_legitimate_concerns.html>, President\nObama owed up to failures in the process of passing health care reform, \"[T]he health care debate as it unfolded\nlegitimately raised concerns not just among my opponents, but also amongst supporters that we just don't know what's\ngoing on... And it's an ugly process and it looks like there are a bunch of back room deals.\"",

He was also quoted as expressing hope that the US would not attempt to act\nagainst the PA's attempts and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a\nPalestinian state.\n\nThe PA negotiator was speaking at a meeting of Palestinian security officials in the town of Jericho.\n\nErekat had added that PA President Mahmoud Abbas contacted international and Hamas officials in an effort to prevent\nan Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip.\n\nAfter Erekat denied the report, a senior official told Israel Radio that the negotiator's remarks prove that the Palestinians\nare not interested in negotiations but are interested in forcing solutions.\n\nThe official said that the US will operate covertly to eliminate settlement criticism from the UN Security Council's agenda.\nIf they do not succeed, it may be possible to veto the proposal or to present a counter-proposal, the official added.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinian efforts do little to promote peace.\n\n\"By choosing unilateralism over direct talks, the Palestinians are declaring that they renounce peace altogether,\" he said.\n\"The Palestinians are choosing not to renew negotiations and are doing all they can to score minor points. They are trying\neverything except to talk.\"",

It appeared that the man wore a Hillary Clinton mask, <http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/man_posing_as_u.s._secretary_of_state_robs_sterling_bank_ at_gunpoint/> according to Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. Shortly after 9 a.m., the man walked into the Wachovia bank in Community Plaza, approached a teller, brandished a firearm, and demanded cash, according to Loudoun County sheriff's office reports. The robber, who authorities described as a black male around 6 feet tall, then fled in an unknown direction with an undisclosed amount of cash. He was seen wearing a black jacket with a red shirt underneath. No injuries were reported, says Kraig Troxell, spokesman for the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office, which distributed a surveillance image from the robbery. This robbery is not the first for the Wachovia bank in Sterling's Community Plaza this year. On Nov. 20, authorities said the bank was robbed at gunpoint by Benjamin L. Sebastian <http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in_regional_ban k_robberies480/>, 32, of Inwood, W.Va. Sebastian was arrested Dec. 11 and charged with six regional bank robberies <http://www.loudountimes.com/index.php/news/article/police_name_west_virginia_man_as_suspect_in_regional_ban k_robberies480/>, including the Sterling Wachovia bank and an Oct. 6 armed robbery <http://sterling.wusa9.com/content/west-virginia-man-charged-connection-two-sterling-bank-robberies> of the Bank of America in Sterling's Regal Plaza. He remains in police custody. Authorities are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact Investigator K. Poland of the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office at 703-777-0475.

    "text": "There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I\nthink it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I\ndidn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear\nlimitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw – and didn't see\nwould be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally,\nit rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization,\nmanagement, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite\nconceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery,\ntyphoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major\ntakeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we)\ncould to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the\nnear and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion – I\nwould have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with\ngrammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.\nPlease do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me\nfirst - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.\n\nThanks,\nChelsea\n\nTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of\nimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:\n- Haitians want to help themselves and want the international community to\nhelp them help themselves – this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the\nUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I\nencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off\nLogbase in days – or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and\nincompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN – UNDP I think - told me\nshe was waiting for the Haitians to \"demand their political rights\" - when\nthey're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)\n- In fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,\nin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/\nINGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures\nhave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie\nVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head\nof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a\nwomen's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a\nsoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\ntshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that – so that the\nsecurity volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,\nparticularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups\nof 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.\nFinally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less\nimportant than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their\nsecond choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at\nnight. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They\nwanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.\n- The settlements' governing bodies – as they shared with me - are\nbeginning to experience UN/INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\ntheir needs, willingness to work – and how little is coming their way. Tents\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs – obvious to\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\nresidents themselves\n- The Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\nrebuilding over next ~5 years)\n- The Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/INGO community has lead to a\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\nsupplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\n~40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for ~45k\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\nwhile most sit in darkness)\n- This disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\non the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week – because it was\n\"such a waste of time\" and he said that is representative of the government's\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\nwere \"more efficient.\" This lack of efficiency – not to mention lack of visible\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect – and the latter feels like very\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\n- Again, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\naround in an action-oriented sense I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\nasked how many trucks were in the country – including the non-Port Au\nPrince UN 'bases' – and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\n\"UN\" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\n- UNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\ncentral locations\n- There is NO accountability in the UN system or international\nhumanitarian system (including for/among INGOs), this is not new news\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\nRed Cross should know better-at the least, the British Red Cross\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines\n- The cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\nimportant no doubt – but it has not extended its work into the\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\nlatrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\n- Re: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact – who working with the Israeli\nAgency for International Development Cooperation – had started schools in 4\nsettlements for at least the next month.\n- The World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally – which is\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\nnext week.\n- In contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\nguarding the hospital – and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\ndoctors I met said, \"We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\"). There is also\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\n- On an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\n\nThoughts on what is needed – and what we could do below. (I know much of this\nis familiar.):\n- The Office of Special Envoy – i.e., you Dad – needs authority over the UN\nand all its myriad parts – which I do believe would give you effective\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\notherwise it could be \"empowered\" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/Port Au Prince regions with constituent\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\n- There needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/warehouse\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\n- A plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\n\n- On pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\nwages until a 'market' could develop\n- The UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\nsettlements at the minimum\n- Speaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\nlocals) laying effectively fallow – and I don't think anyone expects an\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\n- Special/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\nnow offered to rebuild\n- Holistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\n- The UN/INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\n- Re: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\nnon-earthquake related cases.\n- Re: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/at\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\nthe transfer plan is\n- Re: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\n- Re: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\nabout this now – largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\n- Re: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\n\n- Re: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican or even Catholic\ngroups/prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would\nbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work\n- Re: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and\nex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now\n\nFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:\nΟ Near term/for the next year\nΠ Buttress the settlements that currently exist that are not\nin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in\nplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or\nbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security\nand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);\nensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the\nyoungest children.\nΠ Move people who are in the settlements in the worst\ngeographies for flooding or practical reasons/other\nreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime\nminister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements\nelsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO\nShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close\nto one another\nΠ Areas lacking in mention when I heard the above\ndiscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go\nwhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services\nonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how\nto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to\nsecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least\n2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec\nof tent is for any of the above – housing, clinic, evacuation,\nschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for older\nchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial school\nplan; how to best support / help create where needed\nsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,\nwho is in the settlements\nΟ Over next 6-12 months:\n• Assess which homes are sufficiently safe for families\nto return to and subsequently encourage them to do\nso; government estimates this will be ~30% of all\nhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no\nevidence base)\n+ Build semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-\nexisting villages around Port Au Prince where\nfeasible to enable the government to move people\nout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move\n400-1000 families to each of these as needed\n• Longer-term:\n- Rebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people\nwould move back or what the government's post-rebuild\nvision looks like\n- Build more robust health, education etc systems than existed\nbefore the earthquake\n*Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the \"plan\"\nContext\nI spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in\nHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday\nafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region\nSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince\nwith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian\ngovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison\nLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs\nassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to\nthe voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices\nof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of\nCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in\nbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,\nincluding people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling\nwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH – and the person\nwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,\nClinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to\nmove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in\nsettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian\ndoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,\nnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc\nresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our\nnights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers\n(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,\nas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on\nand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,\nhead of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.",

You have\nmassively raised the bar for future donors' conference on how pledge data should be tracked and shared.\n\nHere are some of the \"firsts\" that you should be proud of (based at least in my experience in 8 major donors'\nconferences so far):\n- First to gather written pledges from all donors\n- First to project individual pledges in real time at the conference\n- First to release individual pledges to the world public and media on the same day as the conference\n\nIn addition to these, the work that you put into scrubbing the pledges - with the rigor and integrity of development\nprofessionals - ensured that the pledge figures were more meaningful and accurate than for most other pledging\nconferences (another possible first).\n\nAll of these achievements are great in themselves, but they will be most important in their impact on ensuring that the\npledged assistance actually makes in to the people of Haiti. This is really just the beginning of that important effort, and\nyou will be playing a critical role in it - but you have set us off with the best possible starting point for that effort.\n\nThank you again. It has been and will remain for me a pleasure for me to work with you. Best regards, Roland\n\nPlease pass this on to others on the team that I have missed in this email.",

All major English and Urdu\nlanguage networks carried live the Secretary and Foreign Minister Qureshi's remarks at the opening session. On\nThursday morning, nearly all television networks led with coverage of the joint press availability. All major English and\nUrdu language dailies featured the talks on their front pages, highlighting the Secretary's announcement of $125 million\nin aid to Pakistan's energy sector. Reporting was straight-forward with favorable headlines: Dawn-\"U.S, Pakistan\npledge to boost and broaden ties\" and \"U.S. to provide $125m for energy, power plants\"; The News-\"US vows to boost\nenergy, defence, trade ties\"; Nawa-i-Waqt-\"U.S. will neither abandon nor dictate to Pakistan\"; The Nation-\"\"New day'\nfor US, Pakistan: Hillary.\" Media highlighted the positive shift in U.S.-Pakistan relations, echoing Secretary Clinton's\nstatement that the talks are the beginning of a new chapter. Reports also focused on the question of nuclear\ncooperation and U.S. engagement in the Kashmir dispute; however the U.S. position on these issues had been widely\nreported by the media prior to the Dialogue. The Nation published an editorial, entitled \"Negative starting note,\"\ncriticizing the talks before they began. The daily stated that \"promises will be made on some issues, including on nuclear\ncooperation, which will not see fruition.\" Other editorials stressed the need for a sustained commitment on both sides,\nbeyond March 24, to produce results: Dawn - \"Prospects for Pak-US ties,\" and Daily Times-\"Pak-US Strategic\nDialogue.\" End Summary.",

A few vignettes.\n- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last week, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles). Needless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long and pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.\n- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion. Fair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.\n- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin is met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from the ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's when you and President come on the screen.\n- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the two most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and the bison stuffed animals - who knew?\nAnyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.\nSmart power works!",

Most of the cabinet turned out for the reception that the amb hosted\nfor me. The FM went out his way to tell me what it meant to get a call from you when he assumed his position (he's\nhoping to have a few mins with you in Tallin). As far as Lith has to go, it has achieved some remarkable achievements for\nEastern Eur. They have a female president, Speaker, Finance minister and def. minister. I had a good meeting with the\nPresident and thanked her for Lith commitment to our collective efforts in afghanistan. They run the smallest PRT and,\ndespite a tough economy, have done everything we've asked in terms of additional support since the surge. The meeting\nwith the Speaker and top women members of the parl'nt was yet another reminder of your inspiration over many years.\nOne of the women was at the Vienna VV conf and said she's in politics today because of you. Another read about safe\nbirthing kits in your book and was inspired to send several thousand to Afghanistan. They are eager for more\nopportunities to work together.\nI came primarily to launch the new working group on gender that we and Lith are co-chairing. There was much gratitude\nfor our leadership with them in the Community of Democracies.\nThe meaning of democracy is so strong for people who had to stuggle for it more recently. They really feel this is an\nimportant time to renew the understanding of democ, particularly after the bruising it underwent over the last several\nyears.\nWe had terrific turnout from other countries, many comments about you and references to Beijing and Iceland VV conf.\n(So many people told me the impact Vienna and Iceland had on them). We left our meeting with many commitments for\nfuture concrete projects that will be undertaken. There is great hope that you will be in Krakow in July for the CD\nministerial. The Lith CD coordinator headed to Belgium the next day for an EU meeting. He told me he got a very positive\nresponse for our gender initiative and that Ashton was particularly excited about it. The EU is locating their new gender\ninstitute in Lithuania and they are ager for our help.\nThe Dutch minister who came\nsaid the outcome of their election in June will say much about the nature of their ongoing commitment in Afg.\nLastly, I arrived shortly after the Polish tragedy. There is a very close relationship between the 2 countries and their grief\nwas palpable. Jolenta Kwasniewska and several other Poles came to the CD meeting. She told me that they lost so many\nof their top leaders across all sectors of society, incl several top women leaders. Jolenta' foundation has been very active\nin advancing women's progress in Poland as well as working in other countries.",

    "text": "Dear Cheryl\nIn my last email (Friday, 5/28), I attached the letter from the bipartisan Co-Chairs and Executive Committee members of\nthe Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission sent to Assistant Secretary Mike Posner expressing grave concern about the\nrecent rise in death threats, attacks and murders of Colombian human rights defenders, religious, community and other\nNGO leaders. Congressman McGovern also strongly encouraged the Secretary to meet with representatives of those\norganizations and individuals being threatened, with a particularly effort to reach out to and invite the Bishops of\nTumaco (Nariño), Barrancabermeja/Medio Magdalena (Santander), and we would now add Putumayo, since the\nColombian Catholic Church just advised us yesterday of increased death threats against religious workers there. In\naddition, we recommended inviting Monseñor Hector Fabio Henao, director of Pastoral Social, at the Archdiocese in\nBogotá, who represents all the pastoral work of the Church throughout the country, as well as representatives from the\nMennonite and Lutheran churches, in particular.\nWhile in Colombia, the most important thing the Secretary can do is avoid effusive praise for President Álvaro Uribe,\nwho leaves office in August. Inside Colombia, the visit by the Secretary is being described as focusing solely on the free\ntrade agreement and continuing support of the counterdrug strategy/Plan Colombia. Without changes in the human\nrights situation and the culture of impunity, it is unlikely that anything the Secretary might say or do will alter the\nequation on Capitol Hill regarding the trade agreement. It should be noted that the October 2008 GAO report on the\ncounter-drug operations in Colombia concluded that U.S. assistance was successful in increasing security in parts of the\ncountry, but a failure in the areas of counter-narcotics (GAO-09-71), and a subsequent April 2009 USAID evaluation on\nU.S. aid for Plan Colombia for illegal crop reduction and Colombian counternarcotics policies actually contribute to\nincreased coca production.\nThe Colombian president has been a solid backer of U.S. policy and U.S. interests in the region, and has achieved some\nimportant improvements in the country's security situation. It is important to recognize that, but to do so without\nrepeating the tone of Defense Secretary Gates' April visit, in which he called Uribe a \"great hero\"\n<http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=58754> and failed even to mention any concerns.\nThese concerns are of critical importance, and while the Secretary need not list them all, at least some deserve public\nacknowledgement - some recognition that it is important to the United States that Colombia, including the current\ngovernment and its successor, show the necessary political will to deal with them:\nA sharp rise in alleged military killings of civilians. In many cases, these are so-called \"false positives\": non-\ncombatants murdered and later presented as members of armed groups killed in combat. These, notes\n<http://www.extrajudicialexecutions.org/colombia> UN Special Rapporter for Extrajudicial Executions Philip Alston,\n\"began occurring with a disturbing frequency across Colombia from 2004.\" Citing prosecutors' and NGOs' reports, Alston\nindicates that Colombia's security forces may have killed 1,486 civilians during the first six years of Álvaro Uribe's\npresidency. Alston notes that the Defense Ministry only began to address the situation after the media broke the story\nof the false-positives and the subsequent negative publicity and horrified public outcry.\nThe prosecution of \"false positives\" is moving with excruciating slowness. In perhaps the most notorious case - the\nmurders of about twenty young men from the poor Bogotá suburb of Soacha - nearly all of the accused soldiers and\nofficers have been released from prison <http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49968>, pending trial, as\ndeadlines for timely prosecution have run out. Since their arrest in late 2008, their case has been prolonged by\nnumerous delaying tactics by the defense, including attempts to have their cases tried in the military court system as\n\"acts of service.\" Alston reports that the impunity rate on these extrajudicial murders by security forces may be as high.\nas 98.5 percent.\nMounting allegations that the President's intelligence service, the DAS, was put at the service\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1123> of paramilitary leaders and narcotraffickers; used to spy on and intimidate\n<http://www.cipcol.org/?p=752> Supreme Court justices, opposition politicians, journalists and human rights\ndefenders; and employed in a campaign of sabotage and smears <http://www.cipcol.org/?p=1467> against political\nopponents.\nProsecutors are alleging that the orders to have the DAS carry out wiretaps, surveillance and \"political warfare\". came\nfrom high up in the Colombian presidency <http://www.caracoltv.com/noticias/justicia/articulo168592-tres-asesores->\nde-uribe-son-investigados-chuzadas-ilegales>, though the question of \"what President Uribe knew, and when he knew\nit\" remains unanswered. Meanwhile efforts to reform or dissolve the DAS are stalled in Colombia's Congress.\nPresident Uribe's political coalition has also been hit by a scandal known in Colombia as \"para-politics.\" This\ncoalition has included dozens of political bosses from regions beyond the capital. Many are large landholders with ties to\nnarcotrafficking, the same local leaders who created and fostered the brutal pro-government paramilitary groups that\nkilled tens of thousands of non-combatants in the 1990s and early 2000s.\nEvidence, much of it from former paramilitary leaders, has brought about 300 criminal investigations against legislators,\ngovernors, mayors and other local officials, nearly all of them Álvaro Uribe's political supporters, who made common\ncause with the far-right warlords. To date, of the 278 congresspeople and senators elected in 2006, 68\n<http://www.nuevoarcoiris.org.co/sac/?q=node/64> are under official investigation, on trial, or convicted for\nparamilitary ties. Those embroiled in parapolitics include the President's cousin, Mario Uribe; the brother of his former\nforeign minister; and individuals whom the President had named to be Colombia's ambassadors to Chile, the Dominican\nRepublic, and Canada.\nThe Colombian prosecutors, investigators, witnesses and non-governmental organizations trying to uncover the truth\nabout these abuses are working under conditions of great personal risk. They, too, are heroes and would benefit greatly\nfrom a public expression of concern about the cases they are investigating, and a reminder that their work is legitimate\nand important to U.S. interests in Colombia.\nAt the same time, it is important to avoid appearing to endorse any candidate in the June 20 runoff elections. Between\nthe first and second rounds of a country's presidential election is a politically awkward time for a high-level official visit.\nThough President Uribe's former defense minister, Juan Manuel Santos, is the overwhelming favorite given his margin of\nsuccess in the May 30th first round of balloting over former Bogotá mayor Antanas Mockus, it is necessary at this stage\nto convey a sense of balance and a willingness to work closely with whoever wins. As a result, any kind words for one\ncandidate should be balanced by praise for the other.\nFinally, it would be helpful to remind the Colombian people that the United States supports a peaceful resolution of\nBogotá's worsening differences with Venezuela. While President Chávez's behavior is a significant concern, it would be\nmost unhelpful to be perceived on this trip as fanning the flames of conflict with Colombia - or playing into the Chavez\nrhetoric that the U.S. and Colombia have military aspirations in the region.\nHope this memo, along with last week's copy of the TLHRC letter to Assistant Secretary Posner, are helpful and useful\nmaterials for the Secretary as she plans her trip.\nVery best wishes\nOn behalf of Cong. Jim McGovern\nStaff Contact: Cindy Buhl (202-225-6101 or cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov <mailto:cindy.buhl@mail.house.gov>)",

    "text": "Haiti Still Waiting For Pledged U.S. Aid\nJONATHAN M. KATZ and MARTHA MENDOZA | 09/29/10 02:54 AM\nMembers of NGO Goal work in the Port-au-Prince streets on September 11, 2010. An United Nations report on the\nimpoverished Caribbean state, where a magnitude 7.0 earthquake on January 12 killed 250,000 people, said criminal\ngangs are increasing their grip on many of the 1,300 camps where most of the estimated 1.3 million homeless are still\nbased. It painted a desolate picture of Haiti's infrastructure, estimating that almost a quarter of the 230,000 buildings\ndamaged, including about 150,000 hou\n|\nPORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti - Nearly nine months after the earthquake, more than a million Haitians still live on\nthe streets between piles of rubble. One reason: Not a cent of the $1.15 billion the U.S. promised for rebuilding\nhas arrived.\nThe money was pledged by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in March for use this year in rebuilding.\nThe U.S. has already spent more than $1.1 billion on post-quake relief, but without long-term funds, the\nreconstruction of the wrecked capital cannot begin.\nWith just a week to go before fiscal 2010 ends, the money is still tied up in Washington. At fault: bureaucracy,\ndisorganization and a lack of urgency, The Associated Press learned in interviews with officials in the State\nDepartment, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the White House and the U.N. Office of the Special\nEnvoy. One senator has held up a key authorization bill because of a $5 million provision he says will be\nwasteful.\nMeanwhile, deaths in Port-au-Prince are mounting, as quake survivors scramble to live without shelter or food.\n\"There are truly lives at stake, and the idea that folks are spending more time finger-pointing than getting this\nsolved is almost unbelievable,\" said John Simon, a former U.S. ambassador to the African Union who is now\nwith the Center for Global Development, a Washington think tank.\nNor is Haiti getting much from other donors. Some 50 other nations and organizations pledged a total of $8.75\nbillion for reconstruction, but just $686 million of that has reached Haiti so far – less than 15 percent of the total\npromised for 2010-11.\nThe lack of funds has all but halted reconstruction work by CHF International, the primary U.S.-funded group\nassigned to remove rubble and build temporary shelters. Just 2 percent of rubble has been cleared and 13,000\ntemporary shelters have been built – less than 10 percent of the number planned.\nThe Maryland-based agency is asking the U.S. government for $16.5 million to remove more than 21 million\ncubic feet (600,000 cubic meters) of additional rubble and build 4,000 more temporary houses out of wood and\nmetal.\n\"It's just a matter of one phone call and the trucks are out again. We have contractors ready to continue\nremoving rubble. ... We have local suppliers and international suppliers ready to ship the amount of wood and\nconstruction materials we need,\" said CHF country director Alberto Wilde. \"It's just a matter of money.\"\nStory continues below\nADVERTISEMENT\nLast week the inaction bore tragic results. On Friday an isolated storm destroyed an estimated 8,000 tarps, tents\nand shacks in the capital and killed at least six people, including two children. And the threat of violence looms\nas landowners threaten entire camps with forced eviction.\nIn Washington there is confusion about the money. At a July hearing, Ravij Shah, director of the U.S. Agency\nfor International Development, thanked members of Congress for approving the funds, saying, \"The resources\nare flowing and are being spent in country.\"\nIt wasn't true then, and still hasn't happened.\nWhen the earthquake hit, U.S. agencies sent troops, rescuers, aid workers and supplies to the devastated capital,\nPort-au-Prince. On March 24, President Barack Obama asked Congress for $2.8 billion in emergency aid to\nHaiti - about half to pay back money already spent by USAID, the Defense Department and others. An\nadditional $212 million was to write off debt.\nThe heart of the request was $1.15 billion in new reconstruction funds.\nA week later, Clinton touted that figure in front of representatives of 50 nations at the U.N. secretariat, the\npresident of Haiti at her side.\n\"If the effort to rebuild is slow or insufficient, if it is marked by conflict, lack of coordination or lack of\ntransparency, then the challenges that have plagued Haiti for years could erupt with regional and global\nconsequences,\" Clinton said.\nThat was nearly six months ago. It took until May for the Senate to pass a supplemental request for the Haiti\nfunds and until July for the House to do the same. The votes made $917 million available but did not dictate\nhow or when to spend it. Without that final step, the money remains in the U.S. Treasury.\nThen came summer recess, emergencies in Pakistan and elsewhere, and the distractions of election politics.\nNow the authorization bill that would direct how the aid is delivered remains sidelined by a senator who\nanonymously pulled it for further study. Through calls to dozens of senators' offices, the AP learned it was Sen.\nTom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.\n\"He is holding the bill because it includes an unnecessary senior Haiti coordinator when we already have one\"\nin U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten, Coburn spokeswoman Becky Bernhardt said.\nThe bill proposes a new coordinator in Washington who would not oversee U.S. aid but would work with the\nUSAID administrator in Washington to develop a rebuilding strategy. The position would cost $1 million a year\nfor five years, including salaries and expenses for a staff of up to seven people.\nWith the bill on hold, the State Department is trying to move the money along by avoiding Congress as much as\npossible. It sent lawmakers a \"spending plan\" on Sept. 20 and gave legislators 15 days to review it. If they fail\nto act on the plan, the money could be released as soon as specific projects get the OK.\n\"We need to make sure that the needs of the Haitian people are not sacrificed to procedural and bureaucratic\nimpediments,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry told the AP by e-mail. \"As we\napproach nine months since the earthquake, further delays on any side are unacceptable.\"\nAsked when the money will actually come, State Department spokesman Charles Luoma-Overstreet said the\ndepartment expects to start spending in the coming weeks and months. He added that $275 million in \"bridge\"\nfunds were released in March and have gone toward agriculture, work, health and shelter programs -- not long-\nterm reconstruction.\nHaitian advocates say that is not enough.\nJean-Claude Bajeux of the Ecumenical Center for Human Rights in Port-au-Prince said this phase was supposed\nto be about building semi-permanent houses.\n\"Where are they? We haven't seen them,\" he said. \"There is not much money that is being used. There is not\nmuch work that has actually been done.\"\nOf course there is no guarantee that the money would lead to the successful rebuilding of Haiti. Many past U.S.\naid efforts have fallen short.\n\"I don't think (the money) will make any difference,\" said Haitian human rights advocate Pierre Esperance.\n\"Haitian people are not really involved in this process.\"\nBut officials agree the funds could pay for new approaches to make Haiti more sustainable, and rebuilding\nprojects could improve millions of lives.\nThe AP found that $874 million of the funds pledged by other countries at the donors conference was money\nalready promised to Haiti for work or aid before the quake. An additional $1.13 million wasn't ever going to be\nsent; it was debt relief. And $184 million was in loans to Haiti's government, not aid.\nThe Office of the Special Envoy has been tracking the money delivered so far but does not know who got it.\nThe envoy himself, former President Bill Clinton, told the AP in July and again in August that he was putting\npressure on donors to meet their pledges.\nOn the streets of Haiti, many simply feel abandoned. Mishna Gregoire, 22, said she was happy when she heard\nabout the donors conference. But six months later she is still in a tarp city with 5,000 other people, on a foul-\nsmelling plaza in the Port-au-Prince suburb of Petionville.\n\"I thought it was something serious they were really going to do,\" Gregoire said, standing amid tarps torn apart\nby the sudden storm. \"But nothing has been done. And I don't think anything will be done.\"",

Okay by you?MEDIA NOTEJoint Statement on the Upcoming Sudan National ElectionsFollowing is the text of a joint statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Støre, and United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband on the upcoming national elections in Sudan.Begin Text:National elections in Sudan this month will represent a major milestone in the Comprehensive Peace Agreement that ended Sudan's twenty-two year civil war, and are an important opportunity for the people of Sudan to participate in the political process.We urge all parties in Sudan to work urgently to ensure that elections can proceed peacefully and credibly in April. We are deeply concerned by reports of continued administrative and logistical challenges, as well as restrictions on political freedoms. We call on the Government of Sudan, the National Elections Commission, and all political parties to engage in further dialogue to resolve practical obstacles, procedural impediments, and address allegations of intimidation, harassment, and safety concerns, and other legitimate concerns raised by various political parties. We continue to urge the parties to improve conditions on the ground in Darfur and create a secure environment conducive to Darfuri participation.Irrespective of the outcome of elections, it is essential that work continues and is accelerated to meet remaining CPA deadlines. Progress is needed urgently to complete border demarcation, to establish the commissions that will supervise the referenda for the South and Abyei, to conduct popular consultations in Blue Nile and Southern Kordofan, and to negotiate sustainable post-CPA arrangements in areas such as wealth-sharing, citizenship and assets, and liabilities.We reiterate our commitment to ensure that the referenda must happen on schedule and that their outcomes need to be respected. It is time to redouble efforts to achieve these ends. We urge all parties in Sudan and all regional and international partners to work together to achieve the peaceful future that the people of Sudan deserve.",

    "text": "I just wanted to give you some background on the initiatives that New Zealand and Australia have put together to empower women in the Pacific region and which they would like to spotlight during the Secretary's trip.NZ wants to announce a collaboration between us and their government to increase women's political participation in the Pacific region. Their development agency has made this a priority for the Secretary's trip. Our hope is that S will welcome the collaboration in her remarks at a business leaders, et al reception.Australia wants to announce a collaboration with us on an initiative to combat violence against women in the region. I don't know where this will be included in S's remarks, but I hope it will. Both governments are committing significant resources; we are committing much less, but Australia and NZ are eager to partner with us to address challenges in the Pacific region.I wanted to briefly share some thoughts on this formed during my last trip to China. It made the collaboration with NZ and Australia on deeper engagement with the Pacific Islands on women and development issues that much more compelling.I was in Shanghai and Beijing last month to speak at the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) international women's forum to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the Beijing women conference and to follow up on our interest to launch with the Chinese government the US-China Women Leaders Forum.The ACWF is a mass organization affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party with strong leaders, huge resources and powerful mobilizing forces throughout the country. The Chair, Chen Zhili, is also the Deputy Chair of the National People's Congress, a former State Councilor; the President, Song Xiuyan, is a former governor of Qinghai Province and rumored to be appointed as a State Councilor after the change of central leadership in 2012. I met with both of them when I was there.As I walked into the welcoming dinner in Shanghai, I found almost everyone I know of significance who works on women's issues from Southeast Asia, the Pacific and Africa in attendance. However, I did not see government reps from Europe or NEAsia. It appeared to me that the forum was targeted to engage countries and regions where China is expanding its influence.I know S is going to give a policy speech in Australia during this trip. I hope that you will include our commitment to women in the Pacific Islands, especially through these proposed collaborations with Australia and NZ.As you know very well, the 12 Pacific Islands, though small in size, represent 12 votes in the UN. They long for our attention and collaboration. I think women's development issues are one ideal way to further our interests and engagement.Have a good trip!Melanne",

Op-Ed Contributor\n\nGermany in Need of a Dream\n\nBy JOHN KORNBLUM\nHas Germany abandoned Europe? Do Angela Merkel's tough conditions for aid to Greece mean that Germany is no\nlonger the motor of European integration? Has Frau Merkel in fact morphed from the Miss Europa of 2007 to the\nFräulein Germania of 2010, as Germany's own former foreign minister Joschka Fischer has suggested?\nAs a former American ambassador who has lived and worked the better part of four decades around Germany, my\nBlackberry often glows red hot with messages from persons asking these questions. My response is always the same:\nGermany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.\nGermany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German\nsociety. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and\npeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.\nFrom the first days of the Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely\nwithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not\nremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.\nMany important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of\nothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany\npushed them with determination.\n\nHelmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a\ncommon currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard.\nThe euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s\neastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.\nSlowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,\nGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by\nGermany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in\npursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.\nA new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \"Europe\" in the institutional sense has\nbecome increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the\nGerman Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate\nassistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a\nGerman Tea Party?\nHere we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the \"motor of Europe.\" Ms. Merkel's\nunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German\nwillingness to \"salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,\" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.\nGermans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who\ncan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-\ndenial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that\ncharacterizes many E.U. programs.\nMost maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is\nwhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so\nsure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a\nglobalized world.\nAnd so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that\nGermany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Züricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others\nwhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.\nThe growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to\nburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense\nof common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will\nthemselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.\nYounger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when\nthey rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \"Dare to Hope,\" which is the\ncharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America\nseems busy elsewhere.\nThe main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a\ndemocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to\nhaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for\nGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.\nUniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be\njoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness\nmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will\nbe assured.\nEuropean fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and\nthe United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its\nside of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.\nJohn Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to\nGermany from 1997 to 2001.\n\n<http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0/9/&t=&s=1&ui=1384214&r=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f\n23%2fopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f23%2f\nopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1%26pagewanted%3dprint>\n\nDCSIMG\n<http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7>\n<http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/2c7bce84Q2FRbLQ51TT4Q23TLwQ51Q51Q5BQ25TQ2ATQ22Q22Q2AbQ2\n3Q22Q51>",

To many, it signified the decline of German\nwillingness to \"salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,\" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.\nGermans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who\ncan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-\ndenial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that\ncharacterizes many E.U. programs.\nMost maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is\nwhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so\nsure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a\nglobalized world.\nAnd so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that\nGermany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Züricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others\nwhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.\nThe growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to\nburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense\nof common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will\nthemselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.\nYounger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when\nthey rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \"Dare to Hope,\" which is the\ncharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America\nseems busy elsewhere.\nThe main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a\ndemocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to\nhaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for\nGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.\nUniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be\njoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness\nmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will\nbe assured.\nEuropean fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and\nthe United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its\nside of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.\nJohn Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to\nGermany from 1997 to 2001.\n\n<http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0/9/&t=&s=1&ui=1384214&r=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f\n23%2fopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f23%2f\nopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1%26pagewanted%3dprint>\n\nDCSIMG\n<http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7>\n<http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/2c7bce84Q2FRbLQ51TT4Q23TLwQ51Q51Q5BQ25TQ2ATQ22Q22Q2AbQ2\n3Q22Q51>",

Nonetheless, the article below, just posted by the NY Review, soon to be published, is a breakthrough piece that will have a large impact. It's worth reading, not least for Frank Luntz's poll numbers. The hysterical tone of much of the Israeli leadership and US Jewish community is partly rooted in this long-term and profound development.

In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.\nThe philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. \"Six times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\" he reported. \"Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word 'they' rather than 'us' to describe the situation.\"\nThat Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that \"non-Orthodox younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\" with many professing \"a near-total absence of positive feelings.\" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\nLuntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against some firm beliefs. First, \"they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\" These young Jews, Luntz explained, \"resist anything they see as 'group think.\" They want an \"open and frank\" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, \"young Jews desperately want peace.\" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled \"Proof that Israel Wants Peace,\" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, \"some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends. Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment has been working against for most of their lives.\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster-indeed, have actively opposed-a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States-so that American Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel-is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes. Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \"After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\" One version, \"founded on a long memory of persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in Jewish power and solidarity.\" Another, \"nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment idea of progress,\" articulates \"a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.\" Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.\nAs Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority. You can see this spirit in \"new historians\" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the human rights guarantees in Israel's \"Basic Laws.\" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\nBut in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex-cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \"We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas \"campus engagement.\" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called \"Caravan for Democracy.\"\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be called \"pre-expulsion.\" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\nYou don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank, Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank, he has declared, would be a \"ghetto-state\" with \"Auschwitz borders.\" And the effort \"to gouge Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] out of Israel\" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking \"Sudeten district\" from Czechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the Jewish state.\nOn the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas-like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts-was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \"vipers,\" \"snakes,\" and \"ants.\" In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that \"God strike him down.\" The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \"an Islamic extremist.\"\nHebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \"The last time politicians holding views similar to theirs were in power in post-World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain.\" With their blessing, \"a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.\" Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\nIsraeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school students-and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students-would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey \"a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\"\nYou might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern-even outrage-among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \"apartheid state\" if it continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \"Israel has not been democratic for some time now.\") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn for peace.\nThe result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism. On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to \"free speech and minority rights.\" The Conference of Presidents declares that \"Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security and peace.\" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very liberal values they profess to admire.\nAfter Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents' Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was \"far more moderate than the media has presented it.\" Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \"He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.\" (Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would \"chill Israel's democratic political debate.\" But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline \"Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.\"\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \"bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\" The Conference of Presidents has announced that \"biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save the Children.\" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \"has repeatedly demonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.) Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions-directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors-they leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \"animus toward Israel,\" an alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.\nAll of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics? The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \"virus.\" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.\nTo their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\nIn the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism-with its idioms of human rights, equal citizenship, and territorial compromise-has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.\n`politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the ruins of her home. He said she reminded him of his grandmother.\nIn that moment, Lapid captured the spirit that is suffocating within organized American Jewish life. To begin with, he watched. In my experience, there is an epidemic of not watching among American Zionists today. A Red Cross study on malnutrition in the Gaza Strip, a bill in the Knesset to allow Jewish neighborhoods to bar entry to Israeli Arabs, an Israeli human rights report on settlers burning Palestinian olive groves, three more Palestinian teenagers shot-it's unpleasant. Rationalizing and minimizing Palestinian suffering has become a kind of game. In a more recent report on how to foster Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \"Arabs, not Palestinians,\" since \"the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\" while \"Arab' says wealth, oil and Islam.\"\nOf course, Israel-like the United States-must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense. But they are morally difficult only if you allow yourself some human connection to the other side. Otherwise, security justifies everything. The heads of AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference should ask themselves what Israel's leaders would have to do or say to make them scream \"no.\" After all, Lieberman is foreign minister; Effi Eitam is touring American universities; settlements are growing at triple the rate of the Israeli population; half of Israeli Jewish high school students want Arabs barred from the Knesset. If the line has not yet been crossed, where is the line?\nWhat infuriated critics about Lapid's comment was that his grandmother died at Auschwitz. How dare he defile the memory of the Holocaust? Of course, the Holocaust is immeasurably worse than anything Israel has done or ever will do. But at least Lapid used Jewish suffering to connect to the suffering of others. In the world of AIPAC, the Holocaust analogies never stop, and their message is always the same: Jews are licensed by their victimhood to worry only about themselves. Many of Israel's founders believed that with statehood, Jews would rightly be judged on the way they treated the non-Jews living under their dominion. \"For the first time we shall be the majority living with a minority,\" Knesset member Pinchas Lavon declared in 1948, \"and we shall be called upon to provide an example and prove how Jews live with a minority.\"\nBut the message of the American Jewish establishment and its allies in the Netanyahu government is exactly the opposite: since Jews are history's permanent victims, always on the knife-edge of extinction, moral responsibility is a luxury Israel does not have. Its only responsibility is to survive. As former Knesset speaker Avraham Burg writes in his remarkable 2008 book, The Holocaust Is Over; We Must Rise From Its Ashes, \"Victimhood sets you free.\"\nThis obsession with victimhood lies at the heart of why Zionism is dying among America's secular Jewish young. It simply bears no relationship to their lived experience, or what they have seen of Israel's. Yes, Israel faces threats from Hezbollah and Hamas. Yes, Israelis understandably worry about a nuclear Iran. But the dilemmas you face when you possess dozens or hundreds of nuclear weapons, and your adversary, however despicable, may acquire one, are not the dilemmas of the Warsaw Ghetto. The year 2010 is not, as Benjamin Netanyahu has claimed, 1938. The drama of Jewish victimhood-a drama that feels natural to many Jews who lived through 1938, 1948, or even 1967-strikes most of today's young American Jews as farce.\nBut there is a different Zionist calling, which has never been more desperately relevant. It has its roots in Israel's Independence Proclamation, which promised that the Jewish state \"will be based on the precepts of liberty, justice and peace taught by the Hebrew prophets,\" and in the December 1948 letter from Albert Einstein, Hannah Arendt, and others to The New York Times, protesting right-wing Zionist leader Menachem Begin's visit to the United States after his party's militias massacred Arab civilians in the village of Deir Yassin. It is a call to recognize that in a world in which Jewish fortunes have radically changed, the best way to memorialize the history of Jewish suffering is through the ethical use of Jewish power.\nFor several months now, a group of Israeli students has been traveling every Friday to the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah, where a Palestinian family named the Ghawis lives on the street outside their home of fifty-three years, from which they were evicted to make room for Jewish settlers. Although repeatedly arrested for protesting without a permit, and called traitors and self-haters by the Israeli right, the students keep coming, their numbers now swelling into the thousands. What if American Jewish organizations brought these young people to speak at Hillel? What if this was the face of Zionism shown to America's Jewish young? What if the students in Luntz's focus group had been told that their generation faces a challenge as momentous as any in Jewish history: to save liberal democracy in the only Jewish state on earth?\n\"Too many years I lived in the warm embrace of institutionalized elusiveness and was a part of it,\" writes Avraham Burg. \"I was very comfortable there.\" I know; I was comfortable there too. But comfortable Zionism has become a moral abdication. Let's hope that Luntz's students, in solidarity with their counterparts at Sheikh Jarrah, can foster an uncomfortable Zionism, a Zionism angry at what Israel risks becoming, and in love with what it still could be.

In response, he unwittingly produced the most damning indictment of the organized American Jewish community that I have ever seen.\nThe philanthropists wanted to know what Jewish students thought about Israel. Luntz found that they mostly didn't. \"Six times we have brought Jewish youth together as a group to talk about their Jewishness and connection to Israel,\" he reported. \"Six times the topic of Israel did not come up until it was prompted. Six times these Jewish youth used the word 'they' rather than 'us' to describe the situation.\"\nThat Luntz encountered indifference was not surprising. In recent years, several studies have revealed, in the words of Steven Cohen of Hebrew Union College and Ari Kelman of the University of California at Davis, that \"non-Orthodox younger Jews, on the whole, feel much less attached to Israel than their elders,\" with many professing \"a near-total absence of positive feelings.\" In 2008, the student senate at Brandeis, the only nonsectarian Jewish-sponsored university in America, rejected a resolution commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish state.\nLuntz's task was to figure out what had gone wrong. When he probed the students' views of Israel, he hit up against some firm beliefs. First, \"they reserve the right to question the Israeli position.\" These young Jews, Luntz explained, \"resist anything they see as 'group think.\" They want an \"open and frank\" discussion of Israel and its flaws. Second, \"young Jews desperately want peace.\" When Luntz showed them a series of ads, one of the most popular was entitled \"Proof that Israel Wants Peace,\" and listed offers by various Israeli governments to withdraw from conquered land. Third, \"some empathize with the plight of the Palestinians.\" When Luntz displayed ads depicting Palestinians as violent and hateful, several focus group participants criticized them as stereotypical and unfair, citing their own Muslim friends. Most of the students, in other words, were liberals, broadly defined. They had imbibed some of the defining values of American Jewish political culture: a belief in open debate, a skepticism about military force, a commitment to human rights. And in their innocence, they did not realize that they were supposed to shed those values when it came to Israel.\nThe only kind of Zionism they found attractive was a Zionism that recognized Palestinians as deserving of dignity and capable of peace, and they were quite willing to condemn an Israeli government that did not share those beliefs. Luntz did not grasp the irony. The only kind of Zionism they found attractive was the kind that the American Jewish establishment has been working against for most of their lives.\nAmong American Jews today, there are a great many Zionists, especially in the Orthodox world, people deeply devoted to the State of Israel. And there are a great many liberals, especially in the secular Jewish world, people deeply devoted to human rights for all people, Palestinians included. But the two groups are increasingly distinct. Particularly in the younger generations, fewer and fewer American Jewish liberals are Zionists; fewer and fewer American Jewish Zionists are liberal. One reason is that the leading institutions of American Jewry have refused to foster-indeed, have actively opposed-a Zionism that challenges Israel's behavior in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and toward its own Arab citizens. For several decades, the Jewish establishment has asked American Jews to check their liberalism at Zionism's door, and now, to their horror, they are finding that many young Jews have checked their Zionism instead.\nMorally, American Zionism is in a downward spiral. If the leaders of groups like AIPAC and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations do not change course, they will wake up one day to find a younger, Orthodox-dominated, Zionist leadership whose naked hostility to Arabs and Palestinians scares even them, and a mass of secular American Jews who range from apathetic to appalled. Saving liberal Zionism in the United States-so that American Jews can help save liberal Zionism in Israel-is the great American Jewish challenge of our age. And it starts where Luntz's students wanted it to start: by talking frankly about Israel's current government, by no longer averting our eyes. Since the 1990s, journalists and scholars have been describing a bifurcation in Israeli society. In the words of Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi, \"After decades of what came to be called a national consensus, the Zionist narrative of liberation [has] dissolved into openly contesting versions.\" One version, \"founded on a long memory of persecution, genocide, and a bitter struggle for survival, is pessimistic, distrustful of non-Jews, and believing only in Jewish power and solidarity.\" Another, \"nourished by secularized versions of messianism as well as the Enlightenment idea of progress,\" articulates \"a deep sense of the limits of military force, and a commitment to liberal-democratic values.\" Every country manifests some kind of ideological divide. But in contemporary Israel, the gulf is among the widest on earth.\nAs Ezrahi and others have noted, this latter, liberal-democratic Zionism has grown alongside a new individualism, particularly among secular Israelis, a greater demand for free expression, and a greater skepticism of coercive authority. You can see this spirit in \"new historians\" like Tom Segev who have fearlessly excavated the darker corners of the Zionist past and in jurists like former Supreme Court President Aharon Barak who have overturned Knesset laws that violate the human rights guarantees in Israel's \"Basic Laws.\" You can also see it in former Prime Minister Ehud Barak's apparent willingness to relinquish much of the West Bank in 2000 and early 2001.\nBut in Israel today, this humane, universalistic Zionism does not wield power. To the contrary, it is gasping for air. To understand how deeply antithetical its values are to those of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, it's worth considering the case of Effi Eitam. Eitam, a charismatic ex-cabinet minister and war hero, has proposed ethnically cleansing Palestinians from the West Bank. \"We'll have to expel the overwhelming majority of West Bank Arabs from here and remove Israeli Arabs from [the] political system,\" he declared in 2006. In 2008, Eitam merged his small Ahi Party into Netanyahu's Likud. And for the 2009-2010 academic year, he is Netanyahu's special emissary for overseas \"campus engagement.\" In that capacity, he visited a dozen American high schools and colleges last fall on the Israeli government's behalf. The group that organized his tour was called \"Caravan for Democracy.\"\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman once shared Eitam's views. In his youth, he briefly joined Meir Kahane's now banned Kach Party, which also advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israeli soil. Now Lieberman's position might be called \"pre-expulsion.\" He wants to revoke the citizenship of Israeli Arabs who won't swear a loyalty oath to the Jewish state. He tried to prevent two Arab parties that opposed Israel's 2008-2009 Gaza war from running candidates for the Knesset. He said Arab Knesset members who met with representatives of Hamas should be executed. He wants to jail Arabs who publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day, and he hopes to permanently deny citizenship to Arabs from other countries who marry Arab citizens of Israel.\nYou don't have to be paranoid to see the connection between Lieberman's current views and his former ones. The more you strip Israeli Arabs of legal protection, and the more you accuse them of treason, the more thinkable a policy of expulsion becomes. Lieberman's American defenders often note that in theory he supports a Palestinian state. What they usually fail to mention is that for him, a two-state solution means redrawing Israel's border so that a large chunk of Israeli Arabs find themselves exiled to another country, without their consent.\nLieberman served as chief of staff during Netanyahu's first term as prime minister. And when it comes to the West Bank, Netanyahu's own record is in its way even more extreme than his protégé's. In his 1993 book, A Place among the Nations, Netanyahu not only rejects the idea of a Palestinian state, he denies that there is such a thing as a Palestinian. In fact, he repeatedly equates the Palestinian bid for statehood with Nazism. An Israel that withdraws from the West Bank, he has declared, would be a \"ghetto-state\" with \"Auschwitz borders.\" And the effort \"to gouge Judea and Samaria [the West Bank] out of Israel\" resembles Hitler's bid to wrench the German-speaking \"Sudeten district\" from Czechoslovakia in 1938. It is unfair, Netanyahu insists, to ask Israel to concede more territory since it has already made vast, gut-wrenching concessions. What kind of concessions? It has abandoned its claim to Jordan, which by rights should be part of the Jewish state.\nOn the left of Netanyahu's coalition sits Ehud Barak's emasculated Labor Party, but whatever moderating potential it may have is counterbalanced by what is, in some ways, the most illiberal coalition partner of all, Shas, the ultra-Orthodox party representing Jews of North African and Middle Eastern descent. At one point, Shas-like some of its Ashkenazi ultra-Orthodox counterparts-was open to dismantling settlements. In recent years, however, ultra-Orthodox Israelis, anxious to find housing for their large families, have increasingly moved to the West Bank, where thanks to government subsidies it is far cheaper to live. Not coincidentally, their political parties have swung hard against territorial compromise. And they have done so with a virulence that reflects ultra-Orthodox Judaism's profound hostility to liberal values. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, Shas's immensely powerful spiritual leader, has called Arabs \"vipers,\" \"snakes,\" and \"ants.\" In 2005, after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon proposed dismantling settlements in the Gaza Strip, Yosef urged that \"God strike him down.\" The official Shas newspaper recently called President Obama \"an Islamic extremist.\"\nHebrew University Professor Ze'ev Sternhell is an expert on fascism and a winner of the prestigious Israel Prize. Commenting on Lieberman and the leaders of Shas in a recent Op-Ed in Haaretz, he wrote, \"The last time politicians holding views similar to theirs were in power in post-World War II Western Europe was in Franco's Spain.\" With their blessing, \"a crude and multifaceted campaign is being waged against the foundations of the democratic and liberal order.\" Sternhell should know. In September 2008, he was injured when a settler set off a pipe bomb at his house.\nIsraeli governments come and go, but the Netanyahu coalition is the product of frightening, long-term trends in Israeli society: an ultra-Orthodox population that is increasing dramatically, a settler movement that is growing more radical and more entrenched in the Israeli bureaucracy and army, and a Russian immigrant community that is particularly prone to anti-Arab racism. In 2009, a poll by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 53 percent of Jewish Israelis (and 77 percent of recent immigrants from the former USSR) support encouraging Arabs to leave the country. Attitudes are worst among Israel's young. When Israeli high schools held mock elections last year, Lieberman won. This March, a poll found that 56 percent of Jewish Israeli high school students-and more than 80 percent of religious Jewish high school students-would deny Israeli Arabs the right to be elected to the Knesset. An education ministry official called the survey \"a huge warning signal in light of the strengthening trends of extremist views among the youth.\"\nYou might think that such trends, and the sympathy for them expressed by some in Israel's government, would occasion substantial public concern-even outrage-among the leaders of organized American Jewry. You would be wrong. In Israel itself, voices from the left, and even center, warn in increasingly urgent tones about threats to Israeli democracy. (Former Prime Ministers Ehud Olmert and Ehud Barak have both said that Israel risks becoming an \"apartheid state\" if it continues to hold the West Bank. This April, when settlers forced a large Israeli bookstore to stop selling a book critical of the occupation, Shulamit Aloni, former head of the dovish Meretz Party, declared that \"Israel has not been democratic for some time now.\") But in the United States, groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference patrol public discourse, scolding people who contradict their vision of Israel as a state in which all leaders cherish democracy and yearn for peace.\nThe result is a terrible irony. In theory, mainstream American Jewish organizations still hew to a liberal vision of Zionism. On its website, AIPAC celebrates Israel's commitment to \"free speech and minority rights.\" The Conference of Presidents declares that \"Israel and the United States share political, moral and intellectual values including democracy, freedom, security and peace.\" These groups would never say, as do some in Netanyahu's coalition, that Israeli Arabs don't deserve full citizenship and West Bank Palestinians don't deserve human rights. But in practice, by defending virtually anything any Israeli government does, they make themselves intellectual bodyguards for Israeli leaders who threaten the very liberal values they profess to admire.\nAfter Israel's elections last February, for instance, Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice-chairman of the Presidents' Conference, explained that Avigdor Lieberman's agenda was \"far more moderate than the media has presented it.\" Insisting that Lieberman bears no general animus toward Israeli Arabs, Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti Defamation League, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that \"He's not saying expel them. He's not saying punish them.\" (Permanently denying citizenship to their Arab spouses or jailing them if they publicly mourn on Israeli Independence Day evidently does not qualify as punishment.) The ADL has criticized anti-Arab bigotry in the past, and the American Jewish Committee, to its credit, warned that Lieberman's proposed loyalty oath would \"chill Israel's democratic political debate.\" But the Forward summed up the overall response of America's communal Jewish leadership in its headline \"Jewish Leaders Largely Silent on Lieberman's Role in Government.\"\nNot only does the organized American Jewish community mostly avoid public criticism of the Israeli government, it tries to prevent others from leveling such criticism as well. In recent years, American Jewish organizations have waged a campaign to discredit the world's most respected international human rights groups. In 2006, Foxman called an Amnesty International report on Israeli killing of Lebanese civilians \"bigoted, biased, and borderline anti-Semitic.\" The Conference of Presidents has announced that \"biased NGOs include Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Christian Aid, [and] Save the Children.\" Last summer, an AIPAC spokesman declared that Human Rights Watch \"has repeatedly demonstrated its anti-Israel bias.\" When the Obama administration awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Mary Robinson, former UN high commissioner for human rights, the ADL and AIPAC both protested, citing the fact that she had presided over the 2001 World Conference Against Racism in Durban, South Africa. (Early drafts of the conference report implicitly accused Israel of racism. Robinson helped expunge that defamatory charge, angering Syria and Iran.) Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are not infallible. But when groups like AIPAC and the Presidents' Conference avoid virtually all public criticism of Israeli actions-directing their outrage solely at Israel's neighbors-they leave themselves in a poor position to charge bias. Moreover, while American Jewish groups claim that they are simply defending Israel from its foes, they are actually taking sides in a struggle within Israel between radically different Zionist visions. At the very moment the Anti-Defamation League claimed that Robinson harbored an \"animus toward Israel,\" an alliance of seven Israeli human rights groups publicly congratulated her on her award. Many of those groups, like B'Tselem, which monitors Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories, and the Israeli branch of Physicians for Human Rights, have been at least as critical of Israel's actions in Lebanon, Gaza, and the West Bank as have Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.\nAll of which raises an uncomfortable question. If American Jewish groups claim that Israel's overseas human rights critics are motivated by anti- Israeli, if not anti-Semitic, bias, what does that say about Israel's domestic human rights critics? The implication is clear: they must be guilty of self-hatred, if not treason. American Jewish leaders don't generally say that, of course, but their allies in the Netanyahu government do. Last summer, Israel's vice prime minister, Moshe Ya'alon, called the anti-occupation group Peace Now a \"virus.\" This January, a right-wing group called Im Tirtzu accused Israeli human rights organizations of having fed information to the Goldstone Commission that investigated Israel's Gaza war. A Knesset member from Netanyahu's Likud promptly charged Naomi Chazan, head of the New Israel Fund, which supports some of those human rights groups, with treason, and a member of Lieberman's party launched an investigation aimed at curbing foreign funding of Israeli NGOs.\nTo their credit, Foxman and other American Jewish leaders opposed the move, which might have impaired their own work. But they are reaping what they sowed. If you suggest that mainstream human rights criticism of Israel's government is motivated by animus toward the state, or toward Jews in general, you give aid and comfort to those in Israel who make the same charges against the human rights critics in their midst.\nIn the American Jewish establishment today, the language of liberal Zionism-with its idioms of human rights, equal citizenship, and territorial compromise-has been drained of meaning. It remains the lingua franca in part for generational reasons, because many older American Zionists still see themselves as liberals of a sort. They vote Democratic; they are unmoved by biblical claims to the West Bank; they see average Palestinians as decent people betrayed by bad leaders; and they are secular. They don't want Jewish organizations to criticize Israel from the left, but neither do they want them to be agents of the Israeli right.\n`politician named Tommy Lapid saw an elderly Palestinian woman crouched on all fours looking for her medicines amid the ruins of her home.

In a more recent report on how to foster Zionism among America's young, Luntz urges American Jewish groups to use the word \"Arabs, not Palestinians,\" since \"the term 'Palestinians' evokes images of refugee camps, victims and oppression,\" while \"Arab' says wealth, oil and Islam.\"\nOf course, Israel-like the United States-must sometimes take morally difficult actions in its own defense.

This incident can be profitable if Israel understands it should not be doing this to US or European critics in the\nfuture. This is a downward slope, bad news for everyone involved. S\n\nThe Lede - The New York Times News Blog <http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/>\n\n<http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/adx_click.html?type=cookie&pos=Position1B>\nMay 16, 2010, 11:01 pm\n\nChomsky Barred From West Bank by Israel\n\nBy ROBERT MACKEY <http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/author/robert-mackey/>\n\nNoam Chomsky, an American linguist and political thinker who has been critical of Israel, was denied entry into the West\nBank on Sunday by Israeli immigration officials when he tried to cross into the Palestinian territory from Jordan to\ndeliver a lecture.\nAmira Hass of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported <http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/noam-chomsky-denied-\nentry-into-israel-and-west-bank-1.290701>:\nNo reason was initially given for the decision, but the Interior Ministry later said immigration officials at the Allenby\nBridge border crossing from Jordan had misunderstood Chomsky's intentions thinking initially he was also due to visit\nIsrael. Chomsky, who is on a speaking tour in the region, was scheduled to speak at Bir Zeit University in the West Bank\non Monday.\nA spokeswoman for Israel's interior ministry also told Reuters\n<http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE64F23H20100516> that there had been a misunderstanding and \"officials\nwere trying to get clearance from the Israeli military, which controls access to the West Bank to allow Chomsky to\nenter.\"\nIn a television interview from Amman, Jordan, after he was rebuffed, Mr. Chomsky told Al Jazeera English, \"the facts\nwere completely clear to everyone; there was no basis for a misunderstanding.\" He explained that he was interrogated\nfor several hours before being told that he would not be allowed to cross into the occupied Palestinian territory. The 81-\nyear-old scholar added:\nI can only say what was conveyed to me in the discussion with the official who was carrying out the interrogation — he\nwas receiving instructions from the [Israeli] ministry of interior and relaying them. There were two basic points. One was\nthat the government of Israel does not like the kinds of things I say — which puts them into the category of I suppose\nevery other government in the world. The second was that they seemed upset about the fact that I was just taking an\ninvitation from Bir Zeit and I had no plans to go on to speak in Israeli universities, as I have done many times in the past\nbut not this time.\nMr. Chomsky had been invited to speak about American foreign and domestic policy by the philosophy department at\nthe Palestinian university in Ramallah <http://www.birzeit.edu/news/21160/news> .\nThe renowned linguist was outspoken in his opposition to the Israeli offensive in Gaza\n<http://web.mit.edu/cis/eventposter_011309_chomsky.html>, which ended in January 2009 and has criticized Israel's\noccupation of Palestinian territory many times.\nIn an interview\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/02/magazine/way-we-live-now-11-02-03-questions-for-noam-\nchomsky-professorial-provocateur.html> with Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine in 2003, Mr.\nChomsky said, \"I objected to the founding of Israel as a Jewish state. I don't think a Jewish or Christian or Islamic state is\na proper concept. I would object to the United States as a Christian state.\" When Ms. Solomon pressed Mr. Chomsky on\nhis opposition to Israel, saying, \"Your father was a respected Hebraic scholar, and sometimes you sound like a self-hating\nJew,\" he replied:\nIt is a shame that critics of Israeli policies are seen as either anti-Semites or self-hating Jews. It's grotesque. If an Italian\ncriticized Italian policies, would he be seen as a self-hating Italian?\n\n*\nCopyright 2010 <http://www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/copyright.html> The New York Times\nCompany <http://www.nytco.com/>\n*\n*\nPrivacy Policy <http://www.nytimes.com/privacy>\nNYTimes.com 620 Eighth Avenue New York, NY 10018 <http://www.nytimes.com/>\n\n<http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7>",

Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. Is\nnothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,\" she said replying to questions from journalists\non Sunday.\n\"There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,\"\nHasina added.\nShe was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and\nJapan.\n\"The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,\" Hasina told\njournalists.\nNaimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, \"Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen\nBank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could.\nThe government, however, didn't let that happen.\"\nHe also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank.\nResponding to the query, the prime minister said, \"Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a\npersonal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by\nsweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.\"\nHasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' 'affection' for his Grameen Bank and\nsaid, \"Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with\nGrameen Bank.\n\"One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,\" she added.\nNorway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled \"Fanget i Mikrogjeld\" or \"Caught in Micro debt\",\nbased on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1.\nAccording to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with\nmicrocredit operations.\nResponding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank\nand Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank.\n\"Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to\nbenefit the poor,\" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.\nSent wirelessly via BlackBerry",

Snowe (R-Maine) released the following statement in support of Senate\nratification of the New START Treaty:\n\n\"The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, was signed by the United States and Russia on April\n8th and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13th of this year. Since then, the U.S. Senate has\nheld 18 hearings and as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked with my colleagues to\nscrutinize this agreement and ensure any classified matters are properly vetted. Much has changed since the original\nSTART was first negotiated in 1991, and as a result I have supported efforts to make certain that questions regarding our\nability to verify Russian compliance with the Treaty's limits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to\nmodernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily resolved.\n\n\"I am confident that New START will provide predictability in our relationship with Russia and thus enhance global\nstability, and most importantly, our national security. Therefore, if the Majority moves to consider New START under a\nframework that allows for sufficient debate and amendments, I intend to support the Resolution of Advice and Consent.\"",

Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and\nAnthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their\nfamily.\n\nSecretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:\n\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON\n\nPassing of Richard Holbrooke\n\nTonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke\nserved the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and\nhigh-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind\na true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.\nFrom his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.\nHe was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values\neven under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,\nhelping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark\non the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,\npeople have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.\n\nI had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As\nSecretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the\nState Department and for the United States of America.\n\nTrue to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his\nfriends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to\neveryone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.\n\nTonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-\nchildren Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and\ncolleagues.\n\n###",
