I hope you got some time to enjoy the holiday season and could relax before getting back at it thisyear.Andy Young is a very good friend of mine, and has been a stalwart for the Clintons over the years. He is also one of themost recognized and respected experts on Africa in America. He asked me today if I thought it would be appropriate forhim to seek to see the Secretary to share some of his thoughts on Africa and current issues being confronted there. Itold him of course and suggested that he reach out to you to try to arrange that dialogue. Hopefully that is ok from yourperspective. Andy is a thoughtful, remarkable and decent man. If you don't know him him you will enjoy getting to knowhim. Thanks and maybe one of these days when I am in DC we can grab a coffee together. Cheers.Gordon D.

Fw: Catch up\n\nWanted you to see both requests/comments from David Crane...\n\nBurns Strider\n\nFrom: \"Crane, David\"\nDate: Thu, 21 Jan 2010 15:07:44 -0500\nTo: BStrider\nCc: O'Brien, John\nSubject: Catch up\n\nDear Burns:\n\nIt has been some time since we spoke so I wanted to start by wishing you a happy new year and thanking you for your\nassistance in placing our corporate contribution for Haiti Relief through the Clinton Foundation.\n\nMy hope is that you can further help me with two very different requests related to the Haitian tragedy:\n\n1.\nAfter the tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia in 2004, I felt strongly that the CEOs of American\ncorporations involved in the planning, construction and operation of civil, energy, water and telecommunication\ninfrastructure should lead a charitable effort involving human as well as financial resources to develop an\nimplementation plan for the rebuilding of the country once the Red Cross, the Military and the other \"first responders\"\nhad stabilized the situation. I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is\nmuch closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding\neffort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the\nearthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would\nhave little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an \"advisory council on Haitian infrastructure\" (which\nthen could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on\nPresident Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of\nnames of infrastructure CEOs, etc.\n\n2.\nOn a much more personal note,\n\nBurns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,\nbut knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these type of individual\nsituations.\n\nI really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or\nday on my cell phone\n\nCome visit us in Princeton.\n\nBest regards,\n\nDavid Crane",

Jim asked me to shoot you a note that this continues to be a very important issue for him and\nBill Delahunt. The list needs to be purged of political manipulation - and quite frankly, the current status quo with Cuba\nneeds to be broken, not further reinforced - for the sake of Alan Gross, those on the island needing space to voice their\nviews, and indeed, all of us outside who know change is coming.\n\nIt's time to do something bold and constructive - and in our very best interests\n\nLet us know if there's anything we can do to help\n\nCindy\n\nFrom: Buhl, Cindy\nSent: Thursday, January 07, 2010 1:15 PM\nTo: 'Mills, Cheryl D'\nCc: Buhl, Cindy\nSubject: To Cheryl Mills: Rep.

The letter cites Cuba as a nation that should be purged from such lists, including the State Sponsors of\nTerrorism list, as an example for the need of a thorough, robust and judicious review and updating of these lists.\n\nCan you please ensure that the Secretary and other relevant State Department officials are made aware of this letter?\n\nVery best regards --\n\nCindy",

My response is always the same:\nGermany has changed very little, but Europe and the world have changed a lot. Therein lies the dilemma.\nGermany has worked hard to dig its way out of the disaster of 1945, but trauma remains a defining issue for German\nsociety. Sixty five years later, Germany is still focused on the three essentials of its recovery: stability, respectability and\npeace. Keep this triangle in mind and lots of things quickly come into focus.\nFrom the first days of the Federal Republic, Germany's leaders emphasized the importance of defining interests solely\nwithin a common European and Atlantic vocation. But they also understood that renouncing national ambitions did not\nremove the responsibility to pursue specific German goals through the common institutions.\nMany important postwar accomplishments were conceived and pushed by Germany, sometimes over the opposition of\nothers — including the United States. Ostpolitik was controversial for years, as was NATO enlargement. Germany\npushed them with determination.\n\nHelmut Kohl did not consult before promulgating his 10 points on reunification. He agreed to French desires for a\ncommon currency, but only if it could be a mirror of the Deutsche mark, for decades the European monetary standard.\nThe euro stability pact, now the object of so much controversy with Greece, was the result. After 1990, the E.U.'s\neastward expansion was Germany's way of firming up its Eastern flank.\nSlowly and without fanfare, Germany has been remaking the European Union in its image. At each step of the way,\nGermany made its wishes more palatable by paying more than its share. Part of today's misunderstanding is caused by\nGermany's success in using its contributions to build an image of selflessness. Germany has been as single-minded in\npursuit of its goals as Charles de Gaulle ever was for his, but it almost always left leadership to others.\nA new consciousness grew after the costs of reunification began to mount. \"Europe\" in the institutional sense has\nbecome increasingly unpopular. German courts have begun to define German European issues in the context of the\nGerman Constitution rather than on the basis of E.U. law. At least some of Ms. Merkel's refusal to allow immediate\nassistance to Greece was based on her fears that it would fan anti-E.U. sentiment at home. Are these the first signs of a\nGerman Tea Party?\nHere we find the source of most of the hand wringing about Germany's role as the \"motor of Europe.\" Ms. Merkel's\nunwillingness to sweeten the financial pot echoed throughout Brussels. To many, it signified the decline of German\nwillingness to \"salute the French flag three times before raising the German flag,\" as Konrad Adenauer used to put it.\nGermans are not alone in objecting to throwing more money into the E.U. pot, but they happen to be the only ones who\ncan do something about it. Many fear that without German complaisance, the E.U. will stutter to a stop. But such self-\ndenial could never offer a viable foundation for a new Europe. Neither could the inefficiency and even corruption that\ncharacterizes many E.U. programs.\nMost maddening for most thinking Europeans is the knowledge that the Germans are right. But to them, the question is\nwhether Germany is remaking the E.U. in a fashion palatable to the majority of other member states. They are not so\nsure that its focus on stability and accountability is the right way to help such a diverse collection of peoples adjust to a\nglobalized world.\nAnd so when Angela Merkel raps Greek knuckles, she is sending a message most Europeans don't want to hear. Not that\nGermany is dangerous; even worse, that it is unrelenting. The Neue Züricher Zeitung probably spoke for many others\nwhen it once accused Germany of wanting Europe to become a large Switzerland.\nThe growing gap between Germany's aspirations and the perceived needs of other members of the E.U. is beginning to\nburden both sides. Most Europeans are simply not ready to live up to German standards. Without a more flexible sense\nof common purpose, the project to build a democratic Europe could stop dead in the water. But as Germans will\nthemselves often tell you: They have forgotten how to dream.\nYounger Germans feel this lack of inspiration as well. Dreams were what 200,000 of them were waiting to hear when\nthey rallied to hear Barack Obama in Berlin two summers ago. They wanted more than to \"Dare to Hope,\" which is the\ncharacteristically timid German translation of the title of the president's best seller. And they are still waiting. America\nseems busy elsewhere.\nThe main conclusion I draw from the debate about Germany is that it is not about Germany at all. The task of building a\ndemocratic Europe is far from complete. Most of the foundations have been laid and now the residents are starting to\nhaggle over the design. Weaving today's 27 states into a true trans-Atlantic partnership is a task that is too big for\nGermany or even Europe to accomplish alone. They desperately need some skilled architectural assistance.\nUniting Europe and North America is the most audacious project ever conceived. If it works, the United States will be\njoined by nearly 500 million Europeans to form a democratic space, within which modern democratic values will harness\nmore energy than in any single nation on earth. Democracy's future as the operating system for a globalized world will\nbe assured.\nEuropean fecklessness seems to worry Washington officials these days. But if Germany has forgotten how to dream and\nthe United States is too busy to try, we will both be guilty of perpetuating the aimlessness we so criticize. To hold up its\nside of the bargain, Europe needs exactly what Barack Obama originally promised — the audacity of hope.\nJohn Kornblum, senior counselor with the international law firm Noerr LLP in Berlin, served as the U.S. ambassador to\nGermany from 1997 to 2001.\n\n<http://up.nytimes.com/?d=0/9/&t=&s=1&ui=1384214&r=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f\n23%2fopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1&u=www%2enytimes%2ecom%2f2010%2f04%2f23%2f\nopinion%2f23iht%2dedkornblum%2ehtml%3femc%3deta1%26pagewanted%3dprint>\n\nDCSIMG\n<http://wt.o.nytimes.com/dcsym57yw10000s1s8g0boozt_9t1x/njs.gif?dcsuri=/nojavascript&WT.js=No&WT.tv=1.0.7>\n<http://www.nytimes.com/adx/bin/clientside/2c7bce84Q2FRbLQ51TT4Q23TLwQ51Q51Q5BQ25TQ2ATQ22Q22Q2AbQ2\n3Q22Q51>",
