It is a pretty grim snapshot from a group of doctors (1\nthink from Mt Sinai hospital in NY) who returned from Haiti late last week. Our friend, Michael Hausman, is a terrific\nhand surgeon who was trying to get down there to help. I was reluctant to send this to you because I know how hard\nyou and many other people have been working to relieve suffering and that you and others are working round the\nclock. Nonetheless I thought you might be interested in their impressions so I am sending it to you as a data point.\n\nPlease feel free to share this with others.\n\nBest\nMike",

Our plan was to be at a\nhospital where we could utilize our abilities as trauma surgeons treat the acute\ninjuries involved in an orthopaedic disaster. We expected many amputations\nhowever came with a philosophy that would reasonably start limb salvage in what\nwe thought was a salvageable limb.\n\nDavid Helfet put a team together which included:\n2 orthopaedic trauma surgeons\n3 orthopaedic trauma fellows\n2 highly skilled anesthiologists\n1 general surgery trauma surgeon\n2 synthes reps who were were also scrub techs\n1 trauma nurse practioner to do triage\n2 OR nurses\n\nOur equipment including a huge amount of anesth medications and equipment,\nability to construct 150 ex fix both small and large, OR equipment including\nscalpels etc, OR soft goods, splint material, OR prep material.\n\nWe also had a plan of physician and equipment replacemnt that was dynamic\nwhere w/i 24hrs we could bring in what was necessary on the Synthes private jet.\nWe thought the plan was a good one.\n\nWe were incredibly naÃ¯ve.\n\nDisaster management on the ground was nonexistent. The difficulties in getting\nin despite the intelligence we had from people on the ground and david helfet's\nhigh political connections with Partner's in Health as well as the Clintons only\nportended the difficulties we would have once we arrived.\n\nWe started out friday morning, got a slot to get in friday that was eventually\ncancelled when we were on the runway to be rescheduled the next day. We\ndiverted to the DR and planned on arriving in P OP saturday.\n\nOnce on the ground the hospital we had intelligence that was up and running with\n2 OR's General Hospital was included severely in the earthquake and not capable\nof running functioning OR's as there was no running water and only a limited\nelectrical supply on generator.\n\nWe quickly took our second option\nCommunity Hospital of Haiti. We found approx 750 pt in the hospital upon our\ninitial eval, the hospital had running water, electricity and 2 functional OR's\nOur naivette did not expect that the 2 anesth machines would not work, there\nwould be 1 cautery for the hospital, autoclave that fit instruments the size of a\ncigar box, no sterile saline, no functioning fluoro and no local staff only a ragtag\ngroup of voluntary health providers who like us had made it there on there own.\nTo summarize we had no clue the medical infrastructure of the country was so\npoor.\nAs we got up and running in the OR and organized the patients for surgery we\ncommunicated our new needs back to Synthes and more supplies were loaded for\na second trip - these included battery operated pulse lavage, a huge supply of\nsaline, soft goods in the OR. This plane landed as planned sunday pm, equipment\nwas loaded on a truck and subsequent hijacked between the airport and the\nhospital.\nAt the hospital we had zero security despite promises form NYPD and NYFD to\nprovide that to us.\nOur philosophy was to work like this was a marathon run the OR's around the\nclock with the idea that we would have a defined extraction time of 11pm\ntues. The plane that extracted us would come in with a new medical staff\ncompliment to replace us. Equipment included urgent things to maximize issues\nthat were nonexistent in the hospital that would enable us to provide better and\nmore efficient care:\n2 portable anesth machines\n2electrocautery\n2 portable monitors for the pacu\n2autoclaves\nReplacement exfix\nThings that didn't arive with the previous flight\nThat planes slot was cancelled by the military at 6am tues.\nWe also previously had seen daylight in the remaining patients monday night\nhaviving completed approx 100 surgeries. However on tues morning we found a\nhuge # of new patients. The hospital was forced to undergo lockdown closing its\ngates to the outside and outside crowd becoming angry.\nWe also noted tues morning that many of the patients were operating on were\nbecoming septic.\nWe finished operating at noon tues, the last surgery our group assisting an\nobstetrician on a caesarian and resuscitating a baby that was not breathing.\nWe decided as a group the situation for us at the hospital was untenable supplies\nwere running out, team was exhauted, safety a huge concern, and no extraction\nplan with resupply. We decided to make our way to airport thru the help of a\nhospital benefactor. Jamaican soldiers with M-16 were necessary to escort us out\nwith our luggage as the crowd outside saw us abandoning the hospital.\nWe made it to airport on back of a pickup track, got onto the tarmac, hailed a\ncommercial plane that carried cargo to montreal and had private jet pick us up\nthere.\nThe issues we were unprepared for and witnessed were\n1. The amount of human devastation\n2. The complete lack of a medical infrastructure in the country\n3. The lack of support of the haitian medical community\n4. The complete lack of any organization on the ground. Noone was in charge,\nwe had the first functional up and running hospital in the P OP area yet noone and\nI me NOONE came to the hospital to assess what we were doing, what we were\ncapable of doing and what we would need, to be more efficient. The fact that the\nmilitary could not or would not protect the resupply equipment on sunday or let\nthe tues flight come in says it all.\n5. Lack of any security at all the hospital\nI would take away that disasters like this need organization on a much higher\nlevel than we had with the clear involvement and approval of the military from\nthe beginning.\nCurrently there is Noone obviously running the show and care is in chaotic at\nbest.

    "text": "There is a context section at the bottom, which is longer than I would like, but I think it is important to articulate what I saw and whom I spoke with (and what I didn't see and whom I didn't meet) so that you understand my data set and its clear limitations. To say I was profoundly disturbed by what I saw â and didn't see\nwould be an understatement. The incompetence is mind numbing. Not incidentally, it rained twice while I was there. If we do not quickly change the organization, management, accountability and delivery paradigm on the ground, we could quite conceivably confront tens of thousands of children's deaths by diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid and other water-related diseases in the near future. Below are my major takeaways and a few nascent/early thoughts on what we (however we define we) could to do drive significant and incremental improvements on the ground in the near and longer term. As is often said, if I had more time - and less emotion â I would have written a shorter letter. I hope this mini-behemoth is not rife with grammatical errors or inadvertent gaps; I am sorry if either true.\nPlease do not forward this in whole or in part attributed to me without asking me first - happy to be an invisible soldier. Mainly hope this is even marginally helpful.\n\nThanks,\nChelsea\n\nTakeaways are below, with illustrative examples, in a logical flow, not order of\nimportance. Bolded what I think most important.:\nHaitians want to help themselves and want the international community to\nhelp them help themselves â this sounds obvious but wasn't to some of the\nUN and International NGO (INGO) folks I ran across. The UN people I\nencountered were frequently out of touch (e.g., would not have been off\nLogbase in days â or ever), anachronistic at best and arrogant and\nincompetent at worst (e.g., one woman from the UN â UNDP I think - told me\nshe was waiting for the Haitians to \"demand their political rights\" - when\nthey're asking for tents, latrines, soap, food and not getting that....)\nIn fact, Haitians in the settlements are very much organizing themselves,\nin part to help define their needs and then articulate them to the UN/\nINGO community. Fairly nuanced settlement governance structures\nhave already developed. The largest settlement I visited in Parc Jean Marie\nVincent (40k and counting) had an overall governing committee with a head\nof the governing committee (voted on by the governing committee); a\nwomen's committee; a security committee; a sanitation committee (with a\nsoap subcommittee), etc. Women comprised 50% of each committee. One of\nthe most illuminating anecdotes from my trip was talking with the head of\nthe security committee and a few other settlement residents, including 2\nwomen from the governing committee. The security committee wanted 100\ntshirts - at least though I think they'll need at least 2-3x that â so that the\nsecurity volunteers could wear them when patrolling so that people,\nparticularly women, would feel safe when they saw them approach in groups\nof 2 or 3. They also ideally wanted flashlights to also use on night patrol.\nFinally, they wanted to be able to pay the security team (though this was less\nimportant than the first two 'asks'). IF that option were not feasible, their\nsecond choice was for the US Army to come into the settlement and patrol at\nnight. Not the Haitian police (unreliable) and not the UN (dismissed). They\nwanted to help themselves, and they wanted reliability and accountability.\nThe settlements' governing bodies â as they shared with me - are\nbeginning to experience UN/INGO fatigue given how often they articulate\ntheir needs, willingness to work â and how little is coming their way. Tents\nand latrines / sanitation remain the largest urgent needs â obvious to\nanyone with a minimum knowledge of public health and the settlement\nresidents themselves\nThe Haitian government appears to have an emergent, albeit still\nlargely lacking in specifics, plan of action (detailed below), for both the\nnear (to get through the next 6-12 months) and longer term (while\nrebuilding over next ~5 years)\nThe Haitian government's inability to articulate its plan quickly enough\nor in sufficient terms to the UN/INGO community has lead to a\nproliferation of ad hoc efforts by the UN and INGOs to 'help,' some of\nwhich have helped (e.g., we met no one who was worried about water\nsupplies in camps even though it's a motley crue of French Red Cross, Oxfam,\nIMO/IOM, etc that have achieved that), some of which have hurt (e.g., the\nlargest settlement we visited had 1 latrine to every 1,000 people or 40 for\n~40k though given the settlements' growth rate its probably 40 for ~45k\ntoday; there should be 1 for every 50 people or 800+ latrines) and some\nwhich have not happened at all (e.g., the only settlements with lights at\nnight are those in areas that had lights before that continue to work;\nsettlement at the Petionville Golf Club, for instance, has some lights at night\nwhile most sit in darkness)\nThis disorganization across the UN/ INGOs has had a variety of effects\non the Haitian government, including that it it has now visibly distanced\nitself from the UN Cluster process (e.g., instead of going to a meeting a day\nthe Haitian Minister of Health is now going once a week â because it was\n\"such a waste of time\" and he said that is representative of the government's\ncurrent modus operandi); though we heard the cluster process was\nimproving - when I asked for a concrete example of how, I was told meetings\nwere \"more efficient.\" This lack of efficiency â not to mention lack of visible\nconsistent progress - has also lead to a further distrust of the UN/ INGOs\nby the Haitian government and Haitian people in the settlements. The\nformer feels like it shows up to no effect â and the latter feels like very\nfew actor(s) reliably show up\nAgain, the UN seemed at best chaotic and at worst absent as I travelled\naround in an action-oriented sense I saw few IOM/IMO tents in settlements\nor workers or evidence of work; no evidence of WHO; no evidence of OSHA;\nno evidence of... You get the picture. I did see lots of UN peacekeepers riding\naround however in their vans, humvees, etc. Though on the point of trucks, I\nasked how many trucks were in the country â including the non-Port Au\nPrince UN 'bases' â and no one could tell me. There appears to be NO\naccessible and usable UN inventory system or logistics operation. WFP,\nfor instance, is largely piggy backing on the US Army/ SOUTHCOM but the\n\"UN\" / OSHA could not tell me how many trucks WFP had, much less how\nmany the UN itself had. I counted - I kid you not - hundreds of trucks and\ncars at the UN logbase and other UN bases we drove by\nUNICEF was the only UN agency that seemed to be universally\nacknowledged to be doing a good job by settlements' residents, by\nHaitian doctors and by INGO partners, perhaps in part because of its\nnarrowly defined agenda currently in Haiti (vaccinations) and that its\nreliable - i.e., it shows up when it says it will in the settlements and other\ncentral locations\nThere is NO accountability in the UN system or international\nhumanitarian system (including for/among INGOs), this is not new news\nbut it is one area that the Cluster approach had aimed to remedy - e.g., there\nis no feedback mechanism for when the British Red Cross dug the 34 of the\n40 above latrines only 3 feet deep and didn't tell the residents when they\nwould come and extract the latrines or properly train people to take care of\nthe latrines, etc. - that malpractice continuum is appalling and the British\nRed Cross should know better-at the least, the British Red Cross\nsubsequently should not be allowed to dig elsewhere/ 'do' latrines\nThe cash-for-work program the UN heralds is not working optimally, to\nput it mildly. It currently focuses - perhaps solely - on debris cleaning -\nimportant no doubt â but it has not extended its work into the\nsettlements or helped set standardized, and differentiated wages, for\nsettlement work. For instance, the UN cash for work program should have\nalready started to pay people in the more organized camps - to clean\nlatrines; 'guard' latrines, including insuring kids use soap; be teachers; be on\nsecurity patrol; be on evacuation duty; work with the WFP during the XYZ\ndrop times, etc.... NONE of this is happening as far as I can tell. When we\nwere there the cash for work program head was still focused only - it\nappeared - on rubble cleaning.\nRe: education in the settlements and beyond: This is theoretically the\nresponsibility of UNICEF and Save the Children - I heard they're starting to\nwork on this but that is all I know. Ad hoc schools have begun in some of the\ncamps. We met a woman - our host in fact â who working with the Israeli\nAgency for International Development Cooperation â had started schools in 4\nsettlements for at least the next month.\nThe World Food Program continues to NOT buy locally â which is\nprobably now a moot point as it appears that the dairy, fruit, vegetable and\ngrain stores have all spoiled. The WFP also seems to have been rather erratic\nin the early days but most people I spoke to said WFP is now more\nsystematic and reliable in its food delivery. However, it had not yet\nstarted to deliver cooking and eating utensils though these are promised for\nnext week.\nIn contrast to the UN, there appears to be respect for the US Military on\nthe ground - for the Army particularly as that is the branch people see\nguarding the hospital â and it is a negative comment on the UN forces given\ntheir effective absence. I saw no anti-US graffiti though the walls now are\ncovered in parts of downtown with anti 'ONG' (NGO) and anti-UN graffiti.\n(Also, not only graffiti writers with the above sentiments; one of the Haitian\ndoctors I met said, \"We must be so poor we can't tell them [UN and INGOs]\nwhat to do - or kick them out and use the money ourselves.\"). There is also\ngreat fear - at least from the Haitian and ex-pat medical community-\nthat the Army is leaving soon largely because of the security and total\norganization vacuum that would then be left around the hospital. The\nUN community, in contrast, did not seem to be perturbed by this prospect.\nOn an unrelated note, the absence of the Catholic Church's efforts is\nnotable, particularly given the high death toll among priests, nuns and\nseminarians. Catholic Relief Services is present.\nThoughts on what is needed â and what we could do below. (I know much of this\nis familiar.):\nThe Office of Special Envoy â i.e., you Dad â needs authority over the UN\nand all its myriad parts â which I do believe would give you effective\nauthority over much of then INGO sphere given how persistently the\ncollective humanitarian community holding onto cluster approach. I know\nyou know this and are working on it. OSHA clearly is failing on the ground,\notherwise it could be \"empowered\" to do this but it ostensibly already is.\nHowever, regardless of the attachment to clusters, there needs to be a\nsingle point of authority either over UN / INGO efforts on the ground\norganized in one of two principle ways: either expertise areas (e.g.,\nlatrines, lights) or by settlements/Port Au Prince regions with constituent\nsettlements, with full structures - e.g., finance, procurement, project\nmanagement etc., understanding certain functional areas would be cross-\ncutting (e.g., pay for work)\nThere needs to be a coordinated logistics effort which should follow from\nthe above with an urgency on procurement and deployment of latrines,\ntents and lights - and what is needed to support installment, servicing,\nmaintenance, etc of each. In parallel, a new logistics center/warehouse\ncoordinating facility should be built; every non-UN logistics-focused person I\ntalked to said a need exists for a new logistic center near the major seaport.\nA plan must be developed for the rainy season, which is already on us,\nparticularly for the settlements and it should include answers to questions\nlike where can people evacuate to when it rains? How will they access food\nand water and latrines, at a minimum, from those spaces? Also, could those\nplaces be multipurpose, e.g., also schools and clinic tents/semi permanent\nstructures (one engineer talked to me about fiberglass?)?\nOn pay for work, UN needs to expand its mandate and coordinate with\nrelevant INGO partners to start employing people, at differential wages, in\nthe settlements and coordinate with the groups above to ensure consistent\nwages until a 'market' could develop\nThe UN - IMO/IOM - or someone needs to take a monthly census of the\nsettlements at the minimum\nSpeaking of censuses, the UN also needs a census of itself and its materials\nin country - including of the peacekeeper bases outside Port Au Prince.\nFor example, we drove by 2 bases on the way to Cange and there were\ncollectively, I would estimate, more than a hundred trucks and buses just\nsitting between the two, as well as at least 800 Napali soldiers (according to\nlocals) laying effectively fallow â and I don't think anyone expects an\noutbreak of violence on the Central Plateau in the near future so even if they\nand their colleagues are deployed under UN Charter Chapter 6, surely\npreserving the peace could be interpreted to work with the settlements? At\nthe least, their hardware could be used more effectively in Port Au Prince\nSpecial/ extraordinary management needed around areas that have\nreceived significant attention and offers of assistance, e.g., the general\nhospital in Port Au Prince which multiple actors, including Sarkozy, have\nnow offered to rebuild\nHolistically, all of the above should support the Haitian government both\nactually and ostensibly to not undermine its authority and also to help\naugment and build local capacity and capabilities, where feasible\nThe UN/INGO should look to source locally or work with local partners\nwhenever possible, post emergency phase at the least. For example, work\nwith local solar light producers, buy from local t-shirt factories (if any\nsurvived outside Port Au Prince), mandate WFP first look to local producers,\netc. Now bias I think has to be on quickest production but in medium term\nthat should accommodate a local dimension\nRe: USNS Comfort: for as long as it is there, at a minimum, its mission\nshould be expanded such that its military and civilian staff could work\non the physical therapy of earthquake related victims and ideally care for\nnon-earthquake related cases.\nRe: US Army: If its mission is largely coming to an end, I hope there is a\nsuccession plan for its current tasks, e.g., the hospital security, that the\nHaitian government is comfortable with; currently Haitian government/at\nleast Haitian government people on the proverbial ground have no idea what\nthe transfer plan is\nRe: medical evacuations: think this will be improved given our collectively-\nexperienced chaos on Sunday\nRe: mental health in settlements and beyond: clear people are thinking\nabout this now â largely because Dad asked about it and made it prominent -\nbut still unclear what the action plan is\nRe: Haitian plan: I am not sure it's the best plan, but it is a plan and we\nshould work with the government to flush out the details so it is robust and\nactionable - not sure who the we is here probably most of all\nRe: Catholic church: Could we reach out to the Vatican or even Catholic\ngroups/prominent Catholics domestically to raise money and the necessary\nexpertise to rebuild the central cathedral and main seminary? It would\nbe a powerful symbolic statement - and put lots of people to work\nRe: status, including mental health of workers there, both Haitian and\nex-pat: I am consciously leaving this off as I just can't process right now\nFYI: Emergent Haitian government plan of action, as I understand it:\nNear term/for the next year\nButtress the settlements that currently exist that are not\nin the lowest lying flood plans, i.e., get tents and latrines in\nplace, ensure sufficient amounts of clean water flowing in or\nbeing brought, ensure food supplies sufficient, ensure security\nand safety (though this seems to be people-focused only);\nensure medical care accessible; start schools at least for the\nyoungest children.\nMove people who are in the settlements in the worst\ngeographies for flooding or practical reasons/other\nreasons (e.g., the one currently with 4000 people on the prime\nminister's lawn) to pre-constructed tent settlements\nelsewhere - they have built the first of these already with INGO\nShelter Box though apparently the tents were put up too close\nto one another\nAreas lacking in mention when I heard the above\ndiscussed: a solution to ensure people have somewhere to go\nwhen the heavy rains come; ensure continuity of key services\nonce the rains come; a solution to ensure people are paid how\nto ensure sufficient light in the camps, clearly critical to\nsecurity (rapes are skyrocketing and I know there were at least\n2 murders in one camp on Saturday night); what the right spec\nof tent is for any of the above â housing, clinic, evacuation,\nschool and what could be multipurpose; plan for older\nchildren/young adults who may be too old for initial school\nplan; how to best support / help create where needed\nsettlement governance; how to census, on a semi-regular basis,\nwho is in the settlements\nOver next 6-12 months:\nAssess which homes are sufficiently safe for families\nto return to and subsequently encourage them to do\nso; government estimates this will be ~30% of all\nhomes/families (though this seems to be a guess, i.e., no\nevidence base)\nBuild semi-permanent settlements or augment pre-\nexisting villages around Port Au Prince where\nfeasible to enable the government to move people\nout of settlements to those sites. End goal is to move\n400-1000 families to each of these as needed\nLonger-term:\nRebuilt Port Au Prince though it is unclear how/if/why people\nwould move back or what the government's post-rebuild\nvision looks like\nBuild more robust health, education etc systems than existed\nbefore the earthquake\n*Clearly this is the less well-defined part of the \"plan\"\nContext\nI spent the last four days in Haiti. I was with Paul Farmer (Paul) and Partners in\nHealth (PIH) the entire time - in Port Au Prince Thursday, Friday and Sunday\nafternoon and at PIH sites in Laconville and Cange, in the Central Plateau region\nSaturday and Sunday morning. I sat in on Paul's formal meetings in Port Au Prince\nwith: the Haitian Minister of Health Alex Larsen and his team; the Haitian\ngovernment official ostensibly overseeing the reconstruction efforts/ UN liaison\nLeslie Voltaire; a x-UN group preparing for the PDNA (post disaster needs\nassessment) conference in New York at the end of March working on giving 'voice to\nthe voiceless,' i.e., the designated 15minutes at the conference to highlight the voices\nof those most affected (the 15 minutes I gather are happening at all only because of\nCheryl and Paul), UNDP, UNHCR and others were represented; a group interested in\nbuilding a logistics center for the reconstruction efforts, i.e., outside the UN ambit,\nincluding people from Royal Caribbean, McKinsey and the people we were traveling\nwith, including Wes Edens, CEO of Fortress and a supporter of PIH â and the person\nwho donated, and continues to donate the space at the Miami airport that PIH,\nClinton Foundation, University of Miami Medical Center and others are using to\nmove goods by air and sea, via transfer, to Haiti. Informally, I talked with: people in\nsettlements and settlement committee heads, through a translator; local Haitian\ndoctors; ex-pat PIH and other doctors in mobile clinics in settlements; doctors,\nnurses and US police officers I ran into on the street, at dinner, at their ad hoc\nresidence in the abandoned Aristide Foundation; Maryse Kedar who hosted us our\nnights in Port Au Prince, a member of the local elite, and her ad hoc Israel volunteers\n(from the Israeli Agency for International Development Cooperation, ie their USAID,\nas mentioned above); a broad swath of people serving on the USNS Comfort, both on\nand off the ship; US Army enlisted and officers whenever I saw them; Louise Ivers,\nhead of PIH in Haiti, and others we met or ran into along the way.",

He is evidently interpreting the lifting of the stay imposed at STF to mean\nthat the 48 hour period provided in the appellate court decision to the Brazilian family to turn over Sean to the\nConsulate has started ticking again - not restarted at the beginning, but resumed ticking. According to the Court, the\ndeadline for turnover at the Consulate falls at 6am local time on Thursday morning, December 24. Because of the early\nhour, he will evidently order the family to turn over Sean at the consulate NO LATER than 9am on Thursday, December\n24. However, he will also recommend, not order, that the family turn over Sean at the Consulate today/tonight in order\nto permit him to travel to the U.S. on an overnight flight and spend Christmas with the family in the U.S.\n\nThere is current debate ongoing regarding the timing of the turnover. Daniel Levy of the AGU office in Rio will evidently\ntake the lead in negotiating that turnover, in conjunction with David's legal team.\n\nPress contacts are stating that Sergio Tostes, the attorney for the Brazilian family, has called a press conference at 2pm\nlocal time (11am DC time) to announce voluntary turnover. No further details on that yet.\n\nWill pass more information as soon as we have it. Planning for all contingencies.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nâ¢ Brazilian Central Authority reports that at 1am local time today, the attorney for the Brazilian family contacted\nDaniel Levy, the AGU attorney representing the Brazilian Govt in this case, to inform him that the Brazilian family\nis willing to arrange for voluntary turnover of Sean at the Consulate General in Rio. Daniel Levy reportedly\nreplied that he would only facilitate these discussions on the condition that there were no further legal\nmachinations to delay implementation of the court order, and that the turnover happened today. We do\nnot/not know what if any conditions the family will try to place on a voluntary handover, so planning for police\nexecution of the court order continues.\nâ¢ Interpol office in Brasilia has assured BCA and the Embassy LEGAT that they are fully aware of the status of the\ncase and are ready to provide support if Sean is not turned over. They will have action if the family attempts to\nhide Sean.\nâ¢ We have contacted WHA Press and CA Press separately to discuss timing to release statements if/when we are\nsuccessful with wheels up.\nâ¢ We have discussed detailed contingency plans should the police be called upon to go to the family residence to\nenforce the order if voluntary handover does not occur. Also have plans in place to supplement personnel in Rio\nshould this extend past today.\nâ¢ We have a general sense of the timing of potential events: We expect to have more clarity from the attorneys\nas to whether or not voluntary handover will occur around noon/1pm local time, which is 9/10 DC time. Should\npolice enforcement be required, that will likely mean mid/late afternoon local time. We will advise asap if this\ntimeline shifts (as it is likely to do, this being Brazil.)\n\nBackground Report from Tuesday evening / last nite\n\nPART I\nâ¢ Tomorrow morning between 8-9, David Goldman's Brazilian attorney will go to the court to obtain the warrant\nenforcing the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S. He will wait there pending coordination with relevant police\nand judicial authorities to ensure that everything is ready, and they will depart for the family compound to take\ncustody of Sean.\nâ¢ Consulate General Rio will have cars ready at 9am for transport, and the team will be ready at the airport to\nfacilitate departure.\nâ¢ David's attorney has spoken to judicial authorities and believes that the motions filed at STJ will not be accepted\nby the court, so will not interfere with the return. This does not preclude some last minute legal maneuvers, but\nhe seems confident that the decision by STF will effectively cut off other avenues. We will advise asap if this\nchanges.\n\nPART II\nâ¢ The Brazilian Central Authority confirms that the office of Regional Federal Court President Paulo Espirito Santo\nhas received the decision of STF President Gilmar Mendes. It is Paulo E-S who will be responsible for enforcing\nthe decision from Mendes, i.e. the return of Sean Goldman to the U.S.\nâ¢ BCA has promised to reinforce for Interpol the urgent necessity of police in Rio monitoring the location of Sean\nGoldman. Embassy LEGAT office is double-tracking. We cannot, of course, ask them to enforce anything until\nthe proper judicial authority has sent them instructions, but we strongly urge them to be prepared.\nâ¢ BCA has turned over operational jurisdiction to Daniel Levy, from the AGU's office in Rio, to coordinate with\nDavid Goldman's attorney and with the court in Rio. I have asked David's attorney to try and get some\nunderstanding from Mr. Levy as to the timeline we can expect to see in this case.\n\nWhat remains unclear:\nâ¢ We do not know if the judge from the Regional Federal Court intends to issue an execution order from his home\ntonight at this late hour, or if he will wait until opening of business tomorrow morning. Note that OOB here\ngenerally means 10am for a court. This only underscores the need to ensure that there is sufficient monitoring\nof Sean's whereabouts.\nâ¢ We do not know how Judge Paulo E-S will interpret an \"immediate\" return order - it could mean right this\ninstant, or it could mean some brief period of time where the family is ordered/encouraged to turn Sean over at\nthe Consulate or some other site.\nâ¢ We are working to obtain some sense of whether this is likely to happen tonight, or if we are better served\ngetting some rest now and starting first thing OOB which for us means 7-8am.\nâ¢ We have not had confirmation regarding the resolution of the motions in STJ, but frankly, I don't foresee\nreceiving an answer on that before mid-day Wednesday.",

    "text": "A potential second major phase of the economic crisis, at least in Europe, likely with repercussions in the US, is being triggered with the designation of Greece to junk band status, on the edge of default, with Portugal, Spain, and perhaps even Ireland at tipping points. This is more than a further unfolding of the economic crisis, threatening recovery; fissures within the transatlantic relationship will now be under intensifying strain. More than statements from Treasury should be forthcoming in the days ahead. This is about the future of the transatlantic relationship. Reassuring words about our enduring commitment will matter.\n\nI've been having conversations with John Kornblum and those discussions prompted this email from him a couple of days ago, before the latest Greek event:\n\n- the economic crisis is starting to have a negative effect on dynamics among EU\nmembers. Tensions over deficits, Greece etc are uncovering major gaps among the major players.\n\n- Germany has emerged stronger than others. German voters believe (correctly) that they have\nsacrificed to maintain stability and are increasingly angry over signs of obvious mismanagement by\nGreece and others. The strains of Afghanistan are being felt by everyone and while the President is\nvery popular in Europe, EU leaders miss the regular stroking by the US which for decades has been\nan essential aspect of their self-confidence.\n\n- Germany's harsh reaction to Greece has shaken everyone, perhaps the French most of all. They\nnow see that Germany has been remaking the EU behind the scenes without their noticing\nit. Commonality on major issues is declining.\n\n-- Continuation of this trend would be very damaging to US interests. Global markets could be\nweakened significantly if the budgetary crises continue. Cooperation on issues such as Afghanistan\nand Iran could be undermined. In the worst case, the President could be confronted with a major\ncrisis of confidence among members of the EU. He would be blamed for inattention to the negative\ntrends.\n\n-- Things are not in crisis, but the trends are worrying enough to warrant a senior effort to focus the\ndialogue, especially with the Germans and the French. Assuming the Conservatives win in the UK,\nthere will be a need to guide them successfully into office. Others such as the Poles and the Turks\ncannot be ignored.\n\n-- In other words, we cannot treat our partnership with Europe as just another point on a multipolar\nmap. Maintaining consensus within Europe and between the US and Europe is essential to\nmaintaining a foundation for our global efforts.",

    "text": "Dear Melanne The allegation against Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus of 'diverting foreign aid from Grameen Bank to another company' should be investigated, the prime minister has said. \"Bangladesh has set many examples. Deceiving people by siphoning off their money is another such example. This is nothing but sucking out money from the people after giving them loans,\" she said replying to questions from journalists on Sunday. \"There has been no improvement in the lifestyle of the poor so far. They were just used as pawns to get more aids,\" Hasina added. She was speaking at a press conference at her office on Sunday following her three-nation tour of Russia, Belgium and Japan. \"The people of Bangladesh have been made guinea pigs. I have never supported that. And now I protest,\" Hasina told journalists. Naimul Islam Khan, editor of Amader Shomoy, said, \"Initially, the government had 60 percent share of the Grameen-Bank which now has shrunk to 25 percent. It seems Mr Yunus wanted to empty the government exchequer, if he could. The government, however, didn't let that happen.\" He also asked whether the government would investigate the allegation raised against Yunus and his Grameen Bank. Responding to the query, the prime minister said, \"Grameen Bank had been grabbed in such a manner as if it's a personal property. This should also be investigated. The poor people are becoming paupers. They have been tricked by sweet talks. Finally, things are getting out.\" Hasina compared Khaleda Zia's 'affection' for her cantonment house with Yunus' 'affection' for his Grameen Bank and said, \"Grameen Bank is a public property. But it's being privatised out of 'love'. Yunus Sahib has fallen in love with Grameen Bank. \"One can't but get caught if play with the money of the poor,\" she added. Norway's national TV NRK aired a documentary on November 30 titled \"Fanget i Mikrogjeld\" or \"Caught in Micro debt\", based on which bdnews24.com ran a report on December 1. According to the documentary, Yunus transferred the money to Grameen Kalyan, which was in no way involved with microcredit operations. Responding to the allegations, Grameen Bank claimed there was no wrongdoing in the agreement between the bank and Grameen Kalyan under which it received Tk 3,917 million from the bank. \"Decisions were taken by the Grameen Bank Board, with due deliberation, good faith, and with good intentions to benefit the poor,\" the Grameen Bank rejoinder said.

Holbrooke passed away this evening, surrounded by his wife, Kati, his sons David and\nAnthony, his step-children Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and the rest of their\nfamily.\n\nSecretary Clinton released the following statement on his passing:\n\nSTATEMENT BY SECRETARY CLINTON\n\nPassing of Richard Holbrooke\n\nTonight America has lost one of its fiercest champions and most dedicated public servants. Richard Holbrooke\nserved the country he loved for nearly half a century, representing the United States in far-flung war-zones and\nhigh-level peace talks, always with distinctive brilliance and unmatched determination. He was one of a kind\na true statesman -- and that makes his passing all the more painful.\n\nFrom his early days in Vietnam to his historic role bringing peace to the Balkans to his last mission in\nAfghanistan and Pakistan, Richard helped shape our history, manage our perilous present, and secure our future.\nHe was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values\neven under the most difficult circumstances. He served at every level of the Foreign Service and beyond,\nhelping mentor generations of talented officers and future ambassadors. Few people have ever left a larger mark\non the State Department or our country. From Southeast Asia to post-Cold War Europe and around the globe,\npeople have a better chance of a peaceful future because of Richard's lifetime of service.\n\nI had the privilege to know Richard for many years and to call him a friend, colleague and confidante. As\nSecretary of State, I have counted on his advice and relied on his leadership. This is a sad day for me, for the\nState Department and for the United States of America.\n\nTrue to form, Richard was a fighter to the end. His doctors marveled at his strength and his willpower, but to his\nfriends, that was just Richard being Richard. I am grateful for the tireless efforts of all the medical staff, and to\neveryone who sat by his side or wished him well in these final days.\n\nTonight my thoughts and prayers are with Richard's beloved wife Kati, his sons David and Anthony, his step-\nchildren Elizabeth and Chris Jennings, his daughter-in-law Sarah, and all of his countless friends and\ncolleagues.\n###",

Will share with Jeff Feltman and Mara Rudman too.\nRegards, Deborah G\n\nNOTE from Mike Posner for the Secretary\nTomorrow, Nov. 11, we are completing a four day visit to Israel. I am accompanied by Colonel (Ret.) David\nGraham, the Director of the Army Jag School in Charlottesville. This trip builds on our January visit in which\nwe met with various Israeli officials, including the Chief of Staff of the IDF, to discuss follow-up to the\nGoldstone Report.\n\nOur approach has been to offer our support and willingness to work with the Government of Israel to reframe\nthe public debate from defensive (responding to Goldstone or Flotilla reports and resolutions at the UN, etc.) to\na more pro-active narrative focused on the challenges of fighting an urban or asymmetrical war. We are\nhaving productive, and generally positive preliminary conversations about a possible GOI white paper that\nwould: 1) set the context, outlining the challenges in fighting an asymmetrical conflict; 2) spell out the steps the\nIDF and other agencies have taken to address these challenges; and 3) identify ongoing challenges that Israel\nand other professional armies will need to address in the future.\n\nWe have been clear that this must be an Israeli initiative, not ours, but that we can help promote and use the\nreport once it has been completed. Thus far we have met with Deputy Foreign Minister Dan Ayalon, Minister\nwithout Portfolio Benny Begin, Justice Minister Yaakov Neeman, and Deputy PM, Dan Meridor. Meridor, in\nparticular is very interested and supportive of what we are exploring. Tomorrow we will meet with Gabi\nAshkenazi, the IDF Chief of Staff, and with several other senior IDF officials, including General Avichai\nMandelblit, the IDF's Judge Advocate, who has led the the government's investigation of the Goldstone/Cast\nLead cases.\n\nAt this juncture we do not expect or need you to raise any of this with the PM or other Israeli officials. I simply\nwanted you to know what we are doing, and the status of these efforts, in case anyone in the Israeli delegation\nraises this with you.\n\nEnd note\n\nDeborah Graze\nPrincipal Deputy Assistant Secretary\nBureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor",

On-site observers have characterized the current atmosphere\nbetween the two parties as \"poisonous.\"\nwere invited to Hillsborough yesterday night. However, these\nparties tell us that this was only an informational exercise and they have yet to be included in\nany substantive meetings.\n\nOutstanding Issues: The obstacle to progress seems to be centered on the parades issue and\nsetting of specific dates for devolution. Robinson and the DUP are insisting on the abolishing\nof the Parades Commission, an independent panel despised by the Orange Order as restricting\ntheir desire to parade through nationalist areas, and the adoption of a new process relying on\nlocal councils to refer potentially contentious parades to an OFM/dFM selected panel. Sinn\nFein and SDLP are both concerned that this will politicize decision-making on parades and\nPSNI involvement.\n\nIn late December, the UK government renewed the Parades Commission's mandate until\nDecember 2010, so it is expected that any new process would not be implemented until after the\nsummer 2010 parading season.\n\nKey points:\n\nOutcomes: If McGuinness resigns (likely along with the other SF ministers) thereby collapsing\nthe current Executive, the Northern Ireland Act provides for seven calendar days for a new\nExecutive to be formed. Failing that, the Assembly cease to operation and Secretary of State\nWoodward is supposed to schedule new elections though he is not required to do so within a\ncertain timeframe. (Technically, it would take at least five weeks to organize new Assembly\nelections.)",

KRISTOF\n<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/nicholasdkristof/index.html?inline=nyt-per>\n\nWe face wrenching budget cutting in the years ahead, but there's one huge area of government spending that\nDemocrats and Republicans alike have so far treated as sacrosanct.\nIt's the military/security world, and it's time to bust that taboo. A few facts:\nâ¢ The United States spends nearly as much on military power\n<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trends> as every other country in the world combined,\naccording to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. It says that we spend more than six times as much\n<http://www.sipri.org/research/armaments/milex/resultoutput/trendgraphs/Top10bubble/top10bubble2009/image_vi\new_fullscreen> as the country with the next highest budget, China.\nâ¢ The United States maintains troops at more than 560 bases and other sites abroad, many of them a legacy of a world\nwar that ended 65 years ago. Do we fear that if we pull our bases from Germany, Russia might invade?\nâ¢ The intelligence community is so vast that more people have \"top secret\" clearance than live in Washington, D.C.\nâ¢ The U.S. will spend more on the war in Afghanistan this year\n<http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/opinion/29kristof.html>, adjusting for inflation, than we spent on the\nRevolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War and the Spanish-American War\ncombined.\nThis is the one area where elections scarcely matter. President Obama, a Democrat who symbolized new directions,\nrequested about 6 percent <http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/23/us/politics/23budget.html?_r=3> more for the\nmilitary this year than at the peak of the Bush administration.\n\"Republicans think banging the war drums wins them votes, and Democrats think if they don't chime in, they'll lose\nvotes,\" said Andrew Bacevich, an ex-military officer who now is a historian at Boston University. It is author of a\nthoughtful recent book, \"Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War.\"\nThe costs of excessive reliance on military force are not just financial, of course, as Professor Bacevich knows well. His\nson, Andrew Jr., an Army first lieutenant, was killed in Iraq in 2007.\nLet me be clear: I'm a believer in a robust military, which is essential for backing up diplomacy. But the implication is that\nwe need a balanced tool chest of diplomatic and military tools alike. Instead, we have a billionaire military and a pauper\ndiplomacy. The U.S. military now has more people in its marching bands than the State Department has in its foreign\nservice - and that's preposterous.\nWhat's more, if you're carrying an armload of hammers, every problem looks like a nail. The truth is that military power\noften isn't very effective at solving modern problems, like a nuclear North Korea or an Iran that is on the nuclear path.\nIndeed, in an age of nationalism, our military force is often counterproductive.\nAfter the first gulf war, the United States retained bases in Saudi Arabia on the assumption that they would enhance\nAmerican security. Instead, they appear to have provoked fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden into attacking the U.S.\nIn other words, hugely expensive bases undermined American security (and we later closed them anyway). Wouldn't our\nmoney have been better spent helping American kids get a college education?\nParadoxically, it's often people with experience in the military who lead the way in warning against overinvestment in\narms. It was President Dwight Eisenhower who gave the strongest warning: \"Every gun that is made, every warship\nlaunched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are\ncold and are not clothed.\" And in the Obama administration, it is Defense Secretary Robert Gates who has argued that\nmilitary spending on things large and small can and should expect closer, harsher scrutiny; it is Secretary Gates who has\nargued most eloquently for more investment in diplomacy and development aid.\nAmerican troops in Afghanistan are among the strongest advocates of investing more in schools there because they see\nfirsthand that education fights extremism far more effectively than bombs. And here's the trade-off: For the cost of one\nAmerican soldier in Afghanistan for one year, you could build about 20 schools.\nThere are a few signs of hope in the air. The Simpson-Bowles deficit commission proposes cutting money for\narmaments, along with other spending. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton unveiled a signature project, the quadrennial\ndiplomacy and development review, which calls for more emphasis on aid and diplomacy in foreign policy.\n\"Leading through civilian power saves lives and money,\" Mrs. Clinton noted, and she's exactly right. The review is a great\ndocument, but we'll see if it can be implemented - especially because House Republicans are proposing cuts in the\nState Department budget.\nThey should remind themselves that in the 21st century, our government can protect its citizens in many ways: financing\nresearch against disease, providing early childhood programs that reduce crime later, boosting support for community\ncolleges, investing in diplomacy that prevents costly wars.\nAs we cut budgets, let's remember that these steps would, on balance, do far more for the security of Americans than a\nmilitary base in Germany.\nI invite you to comment on this column on my blog, On the Ground <http://www.nytimes.com/ontheground> .

Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat on Wednesday denied saying that the Palestinian Authority plans to request that the United Nations Security Council unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state along 1967 borders, israel Radio reported. Erekat said that the Palestinians have no intention of presenting such a proposal in the near future and that the earlier report by Palestinian news agency Ma'an was erroneous. He explained that the PA plans on demanding that the UN Security Council criticize settlement building in the West Bank. According to the earlier report, Erekat had said that the PA plan to present a proposal to the UN Security Council on the unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state. He was also quoted as expressing hope that the US would not attempt to act against the PA's attempts and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. The PA negotiator was speaking at a meeting of Palestinian security officials in the town of Jericho. Erekat had added that PA President Mahmoud Abbas contacted international and Hamas officials in an effort to prevent an Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip. After Erekat denied the report, a senior official told Israel Radio that the negotiator's remarks prove that the Palestinians are not interested in negotiations but are interested in forcing solutions. The official said that the US will operate covertly to eliminate settlement criticism from the UN Security Council's agenda. If they do not succeed, it may be possible to veto the proposal or to present a counter-proposal, the official added. Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said the Palestinian efforts do little to promote peace. \"By choosing unilateralism over direct talks, the Palestinians are declaring that they renounce peace altogether,\" he said. \"The Palestinians are choosing not to renew negotiations and are doing all they can to score minor points. They are trying everything except to talk.\"",

Speaking to reporters in the West Bank town of Jericho, Erekat said the Palestinians are waiting for Bosnia to take the presidency of the Security Council before submitting the proposal. \"The Israeli government is witnessing an international isolation that it hasn't witnessed before,\" Erekat added. \"And this is due to the efforts exerted by the Palestinian leadership and by President Mahmoud Abbas.\" According to the report, Erekat expressed hope that the US would not veto the proposal, and also called for South Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Australia to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state. Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Bolivia have all recognized a Palestinian stare over the past few weeks. The Palestinians have recently announced their plan to introduce a draft resolution at the UN Security Council condemning Jewish settlements in the West Bank. On Friday the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat quoted Erekat as saying \"the negotiations (with Israel) are over. Now is the time for decisions, not negotiations.\"",

    "text": "Clegg is still in talks with Cameron. About 1,500 Liberal Democrats spontaneously protested at\nLib-Dem headquarters against a deal with the Tories given their policies, especially on Europe.\nBut Clegg remains in negotiations. He seems quite intent on working it out with Cameron, it\nappears. His inner Tory magnetically draws him to his heritage. Clegg has also misplayed almost\nevery turn, presented with big chances and blowing them through a combination of inexperience\n(derived partly from heading a party out of power for nearly 100 years) and inbred arrogance\n(from no less a privileged background than Cameron, though seeming less snobbish because he\nwent to Westminster instead of Eton and has a less pronounced upper-class accent, more neutral,\nbecause of his more cosmopolitan roots through his family).\n\nWhat about Labour? Shaun and a couple of others have rounded up about 29 votes from other\nparties (Scottish National Party, NI parties, Welsh party) that could be part of a grand\nprogressive once-in-a-lifetime coalition that required the LDs. Gordon has said he will allow\nClegg-Cameron discussions to play out and a general offer to Clegg is on the table, its terms\ngiving far more on a referendum and policy than the Tories. Behind the scenes, Labour is putting\nwhatever harsh pressure it can on LD leaders. Peter is playing a cynical double game. He is a\nsectarian in a sect of one. Yet Gordon for strange psychological reasons rooted in his triangle\nwith Tony and Peter relies on Peter. Peter, according to Shaun, has wrung a pledge from Borwn\nthat if Brown emerges from this crisis he, Peter, will replace David as Foreign Secretary.\nMeanwhile, Peter has advised David to sideline himself. David has done so instead of being\nforward as a strong party man behind Brown in dire straits. Standing back only makes David\nlook ambitious, waiting for Brown to lose and aiming to a leadership contest afterward, when\nPeter, as he has promised, would guide David to the prize. The plot thickens: Ed Miliband,\nDavid's younger brother, the environment secretary, will run for leader against his brother if\nBrown loses. Ed has more of a common touch. The outcome of that contest would be more than\nuncertain. But before that eventuality Gordon's team reaches out to the LDs in private. Yet\nShaun's attitude, as I read it, leans toward pessmism. A London Times polls just out says 62\npercent want Gordon out. Where were the fickle voters in the election? The poll shows more\nthan discontent with Gordon, but also how people are being whipped by the Murdoch media.\nWhat about the Tories? A secret memo from William Hague to Cameron written before the\nelection was leaked this morning to The Observer (the Sunday paper of The Guardian), proposes\nan anti-Europe line of the new government. (I've enclosed the article below.) The atmosphere\ninside the Conservatives is acrid and anxious. But Lord Ashcroft, the Tory moneyman, who\nspent five million pounds alone in marginal districts, is furious that Cameron failed to win\noutright, failed in his campaign, made a foolish decision to include Clegg in the debates, etc.\nMany agree with the evil Ashcroft. But the finger pointing won't matter if a deal works with\nClegg. The Conservative strategy would be to coopt Clegg now, do whatever deal can be done,\nmaintain a more or less center-right but moderated government for about a year, call a new\nelection, win outright on the momentum of the recovery engineered by Brown but claimed by\nTories as proof that the change was responsible, jettison Clegg and the LDs, and govern from the\nradical right as the children of Thatcher for five years. The Tories would then move on their\nelectoral reforms: cutting the number of seats in Parliament, redistricting in Conservative favor,\nand trying to outlaw union contributions to the Labour Party.\n\nWhat about the LDs? Clegg's deal with the Tories would of course thwart any Lib-Lab coalition,\nprobably the only chance for a grand progressive alliance that would keep the Tories out of\npower forever. Clegg's personal instincts obviously lean toward the Tories, having little to do\nwith policy. The party's leaders may be opposed, but they are also likely to be feckless and weak\nas they always have been.\n\nSo, whatever the case, I would doubt you'll see David again as Foreign Secretary. Prepare for\nhauge, who is deeply anti-European and will be disingenuous with you. Tory budget cuts in NI,\nalready announced, would cause havoc with peace and economic recovery. I'd send a private\nmessage asap on that score the second a new government is announced, if it is. Tilt publicly to\nMerkel on Europe for this reason among others.\n\nArticle below:\nTory-Lib Dem coalition threatened by secret\nhardline memo on Europe\n\nâ¢ Draft letter by William Hague sets out tough stance on EU\nâ¢ Leak follows leaders' 'constructive, amicable' meeting\n\nToby Helm and Anushka Asthana\n\nâ¢\nThe Observer, Sunday 9 May 2010\n\nDavid Cameron's hopes of forming a coalition with the Liberal Democrats were dramatically\nundermined last night by the leaking of a top-secret letter outlining the hardline Eurosceptic\nstance he and William Hague planned to adopt in government.\nThe document, obtained by the Observer, is headed \"draft letter from Foreign Secretary to Prime\nMinister\" and was written last week. It assumed an outright Tory victory and spelt out how\nHague intended to adopt a tough approach to Europe at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in\nBrussels tomorrow.\n\nIn the letter, compiled by civil servants but written in the first person, Hague tells Cameron how\nhis message would be that \"the British relationship with the EU has changed with our election\"\nto one firmly against any further integration.\n\nExposing the massive gulf between Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg and the Conservative\nleadership on Europe, Hague says he would demand the right to repatriate powers over criminal\njustice as well as social and employment policy during the first term of a Tory government\ndemands many EU leaders say they would resist.\n\nHague planned to tell his EU counterparts: \"Rest assured that we seek engagement, not\nconfrontation. But our aim is to achieve these commitments during this parliament.\" He would\nalso tell his first foreign ministers' meeting \"we will never join the euro\" and conclude: \"You will\nfind us firm but fair, playing a leading role, fighting our corner, practical and straight-talking.\"\n\nLast night the Tories said they had no knowledge of the letter. But the Observer understands it\nwas drawn up on the basis of detailed briefings between senior civil servants and Hague. The\ndocument came to light as Clegg, a strong pro-European, yesterday met his MPs and senior party\nfigures to discuss a possible coalition with the Tories, who emerged from Thursday's general\nelection with the largest number of seats but short of an overall majority.\n\nCameron and Clegg held face-to-face talks late yesterday as they continued their attempts to\nthrash out a power-sharing deal. A senior Conservative party spokeswoman said the talks were\n\"constructive and amicable\". The 70-minute meeting took place at Admiralty House in\nWhitehall. A Lib Dem spokesman also described the discussions as \"constructive and amicable\".\n\nTory and Lib Dem sources said last night that discussions would not conclude until the\nbeginning of the coming week at the earliest. An emergency meeting of the 1922 committee of\nTory backbenchers will be held tomorrow to discuss the possible coalition. Today, Hague, Oliver\nLetwin and George Osborne will resume talks with the Lib Dems' Vince Cable, Chris Huhne and\nDavid Laws.\n\nBut the stark language used in the letter is bound to alarm Clegg, who has been savage in his\ncriticism of the Conservatives' attitude to Europe which he believes is rooted in the past and will\nlimit Britain's ability to fight cross-border crime and meet the environmental challenges of the\n21st century.\n\nThe document will also be seen by Lib Dem MPs and the party's rank and file as evidence that\ntheir pro-Europeanism would be compromised by linking up with the Tories. A Lib Dem\nspokesman said the party was strongly pro-European, but would not be drawn on the document.\nYesterday Cameron came under pressure from senior figures in his own party not to give in to\nClegg's demands by watering down Conservative manifesto commitments. Shadow defence\nsecretary Liam Fox warned that a Tory government could not be \"held to ransom\" by Lib Dems\ndemanding proportional representation.\n\nClegg may also face opposition from within his party to any attempt to form a coalition with the\nTories, particularly on economic issues.\n\nYesterday the Social Liberal Forum, which represents left-leaning Lib Dems and includes a third\nof the party's MPs, issued a set of \"red lines\" which it said the party must not cross, including\nany measure that would increase the gap between the rich and poor - ruling out supporting the\nTory pledge to cut inheritance tax. Three other red lines were any suggestion of cuts to frontline\nservices in the current financial year, any worsening treatment of asylum seekers and any\nwatering-down of the human rights act.\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon Brown and his closest advisers were working on how to expand their\ncounter-offer to the Lib Dems, including a referendum on changes to the voting system. Senior\nofficials said Labour was planning to draw up a formal \"coalition contract\" as happens in\nGermany - that would bind the Lib Dems and other smaller parties into a deal if the Tory\ndiscussions with the Lib Dems were to fail.\n\nMost Labour ministers now believe Brown would have to step down before Clegg would\nconsider a pact, though senior government insiders insisted this was not being discussed as an\noption.\n\nOne re-elected Labour MP, John Mann, of Bassetlaw, called on Brown to step down as Labour\nleader, claiming that the party has influence on the outcome of the current negotiations\nonly if Brown agreed to give up the leadership.\n\n\"Brown should not lead Labour into any future election and he should stand down before the\nnext Labour party conference,\" he said. \"Gordon Brown's continuation as leader rules out the\ncredibility of a Lib-Lab pact that has to prioritise the modernisation and reform of the antiquated\nUK political systems.\"",

    "text": "First, of course your instinct is right to attempt to save the situation. I think, however, it is fraught. Being right easily might be worse than being wrong. (Doing absolutely nothing, meanwhile, would bear no cost, just to note the benefits of irresponsibility.) So, how any advice can be proposed without potential pitfalls is a mystery to me. It may be that Bill delivers the message in public, on the stump. This message, on extremism and the GOP, ought to be given soon, on Labor Day or immediately thereafter. Urgently, the momentum of the far right needs to be blunted; it must be redefined; the political discussion must be shaped and shifted; and the GOP must be put on the defensive and begin to pay the price. I will send you another memo soon, with other messages, themes and strategies. Here, for better or worse, is some language on extremism and the Republican Party: The Republican Party today is a captive party. It is captive to the swamp fevers of the extreme right. It is captive to its out-of-power desperation for political powerâwilling to do and say anything to grab itâwilling to use extremists to help climb back to powerâwilling to give the extremists power. No one is speaking up for responsible conservatism within the Republican Party. Who will play the role of William F. Buckley, Jr.? Or Richard Nixon? Or Ronald Reagan? Or Barry Goldwater? They all drew lines to separate the party from the extremists. Now who has the courage to condemn the outrageous bigotry and slander against the President? Have they at long last no sense of decency? If the Republicans don't have the nerve to speak up for their own best heritage, then someone has to do it. The Republican Party is in a state of political disorder. Into the midst of its chaos a Trojan Horse has been thrust in the form of a self-proclaimed Tea Party as though the extremists behind it have something to do with the American Revolution and are not a stealth takeover operation of a confused political party funded by the same people who paid for the extremist movements against President Eisenhower and President Kennedy. There is a straight line between extremists then and extremists now. One of those lines is a money line. Follow the money. Another continuity is the far right John Birch Society that is praised today by Glenn Beck. Listen closely. Yet another of those lines are the same accusations of disloyalty. Ike was a Communist. John F. Kennedy was a Communist. They said President Nixon was a tool of international Communism. And when the Cold War was ending they said Ronald Reagan was \"a useful idiot of the Kremlin.\" Now they are saying that President Obama is a socialist and at the same time a fascist. They say he's a racist and a secret Muslim. They claim the President of the United States is not an American. It's so crazy it sounds like a science fiction novel, but we've heard it all before. The extremists have not changed. From Ike to JFK, from Nixon to Reagan, and now Obama, it's the same old horsestuff. For anyone with common sense it might seem like one big joke, a big put-on, or maybe just a big con job. But it's dangerous. It's toxic. Why? In the name of the founding fathers, the Constitution and the flag, in the name of taking back our country and restoring it, they would transform our democracy into something we wouldn't recognize. The extremists of the far right want to replace the greatest experiment in constitutional democracy with their own far-out ideologyâtrashing everything from religious liberty to protections from a dog-eat-dog boom and bust economy. Public education, a safe environment, national highways, safe transportation, Social Security, Medicare, health care for all, even the Federal Reserve created to curb economic chaosâthey want to get rid of all of it. If you think that if they had their way they wouldn't kick the country into an economic abyss, produce another Great Depression, then I've got a reality show in Alaska for you. And that's not all that's in their sweeping blueprint for power. The Republican Party is being purged of moderates, responsible conservatives, anyone who has a thought they don't like. It's divide and conquer. Divide the Republican Party. Divide the nation. Region against region, South against North, West against East, rural America against cities, state governments against the federal government, religion against religion, and soon, before you know it, it won't look or feel like America. Out of loud declarations of love of country, they will break this country apart. How far do the extremists want to go? The demonizing of enemies and even religions is a means to an end. That end is political power. Political power for themselves, for their political leadersâcharacters who are hardly outsiders but dusty denizens roaming the corridors of power for decades. They want political powerâpolitical power for favors, exemptions and loopholes for the Daddy Warbucks and Scrooge McDucks funding them. Political power for special interests. Political power against the national interest. Political power against the common good. Political power against the good society. President Obama is their target because the people have put him in his office and he stands in the way of the extremists. They are against him precisely because he's making progress. And progress is not what they want. They want power for themselves. So they will say anything to tear down the President. But they are at war with more than President Obama. They are at war with President Andrew Jackson. That's how far back they want to go. They want to go back the 1830s. They want to go back to before the Civil War, \"lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification,\" to quote Martin Luther King, Jr. in his famous \"I have a dream\" speech. They want to interpose their rule and their power above that of majority rule and democratic government and nullify the law of the land in the name of their strange doctrines. So when I say that this is dangerous and toxic, we've been there before. Fanatics have divided America in the past. We know, as another president said, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand.\" And when you see them demonizing the President, Ike, JFK, Obama, take your pickâwhen you see them accusing members of the Republican Party of treasonâwhen you hear them compare the American experiment in democracy to Hitler's Nazi state or Stalin's Communist totalitarianismâwhen you hear them talk of \"liberty\" and they mean taking away Social Security from people who worked their whole lives to earn itâwhen you hear them talk of \"freedom\" when they want to bring back good old fashioned discriminationâwhen you hear them talk of \"the Constitution\" when they want to get rid of the letter and spirit of the government designed by the framers of the Constitutionâwhen you hear them talk of \"democracy\" when they want to get rid of direct election of senatorsâwhen you hear them talk about \"restoration\" when they want to gut public education and Medicare and basic economic and environmental protectionsâtrashing the work and progress of generationsâthen you know that behind the patriotic words lies a truly radical agenda. It was Dwight Eisenhower who warned: \"Should any political party attempt to abolish Social Security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor laws and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history. There is a tiny splinter group, of course, that believes you can do these things. Among them are H. L. Hunt (you possibly know his background), a few other Texas oil millionaires, and an occasional politician or business man from other areas. Their number is negligible and they are stupid.\" It was John F. Kennedy who said: \"In the most critical periods of our nation's history, there have always been those fringes of our society who have sought to escape their own responsibility by finding a simple solution, an appealing slogan, or a convenient scapegoat. Financial crises could be explained by the presence of too many immigrants or too few greenbacks... So let us not heed these counsels of fear and suspicion... Let our patriotism be reflected in the creation of confidence rather than crusades of suspicion. Let us prove we think our country great by striving to make it greater.\" Outspoken conservatives like William F. Buckley drew the line and stood up for principle against the extremists, calling them \"idiotic\" and \"paranoid.\" Barry Goldwater, at the end of his life, said, \"Do not associate my name with anything you do. You are extremists, and you've hurt the Republican Party much more than the Democrats have.\" Then, this sort of thing, instilling a tone of confidence: Come together, right now...for a new era of progress...rebuilding America...the work of a new generation...building on the progress of generations...facing any challenge...resolving that we can and will overcome any obstacle...keeping the faith, not succumbing to temptations of fear and suspicion...not retreating but advancing...not dividing the American people for short-term politics but bringing the American people together for long-term progress...combining our will, our work, our intelligence, creativity, enterprise, and energy to make a new world of freedom for ourselves and our children...",

    "text": "For: Hillary\nFrom: Sid\nRe: Hague meeting\nOn your meeting on Friday, May 14, with new British Foreign Secretary William Hague you might explore a\nnumber of issues below. (I've discussed with Shaun.)\n\nNorthern Ireland. Cameron has pledged to reduce public sector spending in NI. But the impact of public\nsector spending there is not the same as in other parts of the UK because of 40 years of troubles.\nPolitical stability depends upon economic stability. Removing funding specifically threatens community\npolicing, creating a vacuum that the Real IRA and other men of violence would rush into. Cutting the\npublic sector would make it difficult to increase private sector investment. Does the new government\nunderstand the US interest in NI and appreciate the fragility of the situation?\nDefense and Foreign Policy Cuts. The new government program is to slash the deficit, cutting deeply into\ngovernment programs. This really cannot be done without defense and foreign policy reductions. Seek\nclaficiation on exactly whether and where these cuts be made. Will they affect Afghanistan policy and\nover what schedule? How will cuts in the foreign service affect British influence in other areas?\nTrident and Nuclear Deterrent. The coalition agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats\nallows the LDs to abstain in parliamentary votes on four issues that will apparently let the Tories have\ntheir way: marriage tax allowances; nuclear power; college tuition fees; and Trident and the nuclear\ndeterrent. During the campaign, the LDs ran on eliminating the Trident and erasing the UK nuclear\ndeterrent. How will this actually work in practice?\nPolitical Changes. The new government, because the coalition is fundamentally at odds with itself, has\nproposed to pass a parliamentary bill that establishes a five year term for a government and furthermore\nestablishes that a vote of no confidence can only be passed on a 55 percent vote. You might just seek\nHague's view on how this will work.",

Robert Pape is a top strategic thinker from U of Chicago who is best known for his empirical work showing a strong correlation between suicide terrorism and occupation by foreign troops. In his new work he is proposing a grand strategy of off-shore/on-shore balancing. Below is the elevator version, or at least an academic's version of the elevator version. What is interesting is how closely it tracks with our emphasis on civilian power and the need for a smaller military due to budget constraints. If you want more the attached one-page proposal outlines a 3-year series of steps to apply this proposal to Afghanistan. \"An Alternative Security Strategy. Off-shore/on-shore balancing seeks to achieve America's core national security objectives through a combination of over-the-horizon (\"off-shore\") military power and in-region (\"on-shore\") economic and political power. Off-shore/on-shore balancing is an alternative to advancing U.S. security goals through the deployment of large ground forces overseas, already problematic and likely to become even more so as economic challenges continue and chronic resentment deepens. Off-shore/on-shore balancing relies on naval, air, and rapidly deployable ground forces in combination with on-site economic and political support for local partners to secure America's interests in combating terrorism and achieving other key national security goals, particularly in the Middle East and Asia.\" AM",

A few vignettes.\n\n- while we don't want to brag to our Chinese hosts, our Pavilion has become the most popular. During the trial runs last\nweek, the Chinese expo-goers rushed directly from the gates to the USAP (and even broke some of our turn-styles).\nNeedless to say, the Chinese have improved security. On EACH of the first two days, 30,000 pple visited. Lines are long\nand pple are loving the show. We are also getting many foreign officials to visit.\n\n- the 100 US college student ambassadors (who act as guides and speak Mandarin) are the biggest hits of the pavilion.\nFair-goers stand in line to have their photo's taken w them. They explain the show and send a great message.\n\n- the story line that we thght was simplistic is quite popular (the overture where Americans try to say hello in mandarin\nis met w howls of laughter and Act II called the Garden is doing well). During the thunderstorm scene a mist comes from\nthe ceiling and some pple put up their umbrellas. Act I is a bit too commercial but the audience claps and take photo's\nwhen you and President come on the screen.\n\n- we are selling tons of USA merchandise - the most popular items - mini-basketballs with the USAP seal on it and\nthe bison stuffed animals - who knew?\n\nAnyway, thght u'd enjoy the quick report. I cannot imagine us not being here! We will keep you posted.\n\nSmart power works!",

Dick\nLugar said today after attending the White House Rose Garden ceremony with President Barack Obama hosting\nHaitian President RenÃ© PrÃ©val. Earlier in the day, former President Bill Clinton also told the Senate Foreign\nRelations Committee that this should be a priority.\n\n\"As the Administration prepares to present its supplemental appropriations request for Haiti, a top priority for\nrecovery and long term reconstruction efforts in Haiti should include significant assistance to get Haitian\nchildren quickly back into the classroom,\" Lugar said. \"Assistance for infrastructure, technical assistance for\ninstruction and curriculum development especially should be included. Only with a strong education initiative\nwill Haiti have a chance at a better future.\"\n\nLugar directed two staff members to accompany a Congressional Delegation to Haiti on Friday, March 5.\nDuring the visit, staff saw firsthand the devastation experienced by Haitians and reported to Lugar that\nthousands of schools in and around Port au Prince could remain closed for months or never reopen. As a result,\nHaitian children could be left languishing in refugee camps. Before the January 12 earthquake approximately\none-half of Haiti's school-age children were enrolled in classes. Children make up about 45 percent of Haiti's\npopulation.\n\n\"The relationship between the United States and the Haitian government should be a consensual, cooperative\narrangement that preserves Haitian participation in decisions, while ensuring that the resources and expertise of\nthe United States Government and international community are brought to bear on the daily problems of Haiti.\nEducation of the Haiti's youth is an appropriate starting point,\" Lugar said.\n###",

I think the concept is even more relevant in 2010 with respect to Haiti which obviously is\nmuch closer to the United States and has much less indigenous skills and resources of its own to apply to the rebuilding\neffort. Given President Clinton's normal powers of persuasion and his passion for improving Haiti even before the\nearthquake (it was the only thing he wanted to talk about when Isabella and I met with him in November), he would\nhave little difficulty recruiting a group of appropriate CEOs to form an \"advisory council on Haitian infrastructure\" (which\nthen could springboard to greater things and deeper commitments). If you could reach out to the appropriate person on\nPresident Clinton's staff, we of course would be available to assist in giving shape to the concept, compiling a list of\nnames of infrastructure CEOs, etc.\n2.\nOn a much more personal note,\nBurns, I know President Clinton is devoting all of his herculean energy to humanitarian relief for Haiti at the macro level,\nbut knowing his humanistic approach, there must be someone on his staff who can help with these type of individual\nsituations.\nI really appreciate your assistance with respect to both of these matters. Please do not hesitate to contact me night or\nday on my cell phone\nCome visit us in Princeton.\nBest regards,\nDavid Crane",

Koch in 1996. He and his brother Charles are lifelong libertarians and have quietly given more than a hundred milliondollars to right-wing causes.On May 17th, a black-tie audience at the Metropolitan Opera House applauded as a tall, jovial-looking billionaire took thestage. It was the seventieth annual spring gala of American Ballet Theatre, and David H. Koch was being celebrated for hisgenerosity as a member of the board of trustees; he had recently donated $2.5 million toward the company's upcoming season,and had given many millions before that. Koch received an award while flanked by two of the gala's co-chairs, Blaine Trump,in a peach-colored gown, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, in emerald green. Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline KennedyOnassis, had been a patron of the ballet and, coincidentally, the previous owner of a Fifth Avenue apartment that Koch hadbought, in 1995, and then sold, eleven years later, for thirty-two million dollars, having found it too small.The gala marked the social ascent of Koch, who, at the age of seventy, has become one of the city's most prominentphilanthropists. In 2008, he donated a hundred million dollars to modernize Lincoln Center's New York State Theatre building,which now bears his name. He has given twenty million to the American Museum of Natural History, whose dinosaur wing isnamed for him. This spring, after noticing the decrepit state of the fountains outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Kochpledged at least ten million dollars for their renovation. He is a trustee of the museum, perhaps the most coveted social prize inthe city, and serves on the board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where, after he donated more than forty milliondollars, an endowed chair and a research center were named for him.One dignitary was conspicuously absent from the gala: the event's third honorary co-chair, Michelle Obama. Her officesaid that a scheduling conflict had prevented her from attending. Yet had the First Lady shared the stage with Koch it mighthave created an awkward tableau. In Washington, Koch is best known as part of a family that has repeatedly funded stealthattacks on the federal government, and on the Obama Administration in particular.With his brother Charles, who is seventy-four, David Koch owns virtually all of Koch Industries, a conglomerate,headquartered in Wichita, Kansas, whose annual revenues are estimated to be a hundred billion dollars. The company hasgrown spectacularly since their father, Fred, died, in 1967, and the brothers took charge. The Kochs operate oil refineries inAlaska, Texas, and Minnesota, and control some four thousand miles of pipeline. Koch Industries owns Brawny paper towels,Dixie cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, StainÄ±master carpet, and Lycra, among other products. Forbes ranks it as the second-largestprivate company in the country, after Cargill, and its consistent profitability has made David and Charles Kochâwho, yearsago, bought out two other brothersâamong the richest men in America. Their combined fortune of thirty-five billion dollars isexceeded only by those of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett.The Kochs are longtime libertarians who believe in drastically lower personal and corporate taxes, minimal social servicesfor the needy, and much less oversight of industryâespecially environmental regulation. These views dovetail with thebrothers' corporate interests. In a study released this spring, the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's Political EconomyResearch Institute named Koch Industries one of the top ten air polluters in the United States. And Greenpeace issued a reportidentifying the company as a \"kingpin of climate science denial.\" The report showed that, from 2005 to 2008, the Kochs vastlyoutdid ExxonMobil in giving money to organizations fighting legislation related to climate change, underwriting a hugenetwork of foundations, think tanks, and political front groups. Indeed, the brothers have funded opposition campaigns againstso many Obama Administration policiesâfrom health-care reform to the economic-stimulus programâthat, in political circles,their ideological network is known as the Kochtopus.In a statement, Koch Industries said that the Greenpeace report \"distorts the environmental record of our companies.\" And.David Koch, in a recent, admiring article about him in New York, protested that the \"radical press\" had turned his family into\"whipping boys,\" and had exaggerated its influence on American politics. But Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center forPublic Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said, \"The Kochs are on a whole different level. There's no one else who hasspent this much money. The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, politicalmanipulation, and obfuscation. I've been in Washington since Watergate, and I've never seen anything like it. They are theStandard Oil of our times.\"few weeks after the Lincoln Center gala, the advocacy wing of the Americans for Prosperity Foundationâan organization thatDavid Koch started, in 2004âheld a different kind of gathering. Over the July 4th weekend, a summit called Texas Defendingthe American Dream took place in a chilly hotel ballroom in Austin. Though Koch freely promotes his philanthropic ventures,he did not attend the summit, and his name was not in evidence. And on this occasion the audience was roused not by a danceperforinance but by a series of speakers denouncing President Barack Obama. Peggy Venable, the organizer of the summit,warned that Administration officials \"have a socialist vision for this country.\"Five hundred people attended the summit, which served, in part, as a training session for Tea Party activists in Texas. Anadvertisement cast the event as a populist uprising against vested corporate power. \"Today, the voices of average Americans arebeing drowned out by lobbyists and special interests,\" it said. \"But you can do something about it.\" The pitch made no mentionof its corporate funders. The White House has expressed frustration that such sponsors have largely eluded public notice. DavidAxelrod, Obama's senior adviser, said, \"What they don't say is that, in part, this is a grassroots citizens' movement brought toyou by a bunch of oil billionaires.\"In April, 2009, Melissa Cohlmia, a company spokesperson, denied that the Kochs had direct links to the Tea Party, sayingthat Americans for Prosperity is \"an independent organization and Koch companies do not in any way direct their activities.\"Later, she issued a statement: \"No funding has been provided by Koch companies, the Koch foundations, or Charles Koch oriDavid Koch specifically to support the tea parties.\" David Koch told New York, \"I've never been to a tea-party event. No onerepresenting the tea party has ever even approached me.\"At the lectern in Austin, however, Venableâa longtime political operative who draws a salary from Americans forProsperity, and who has worked for Koch-funded political groups since 1994âspoke less warily. \"We love what the TeaParties are doing, because that's how we're going to take back America!\" she declared, as the crowd cheered. In a subsequentinterview, she described herself as an early member of the movement, joking, \"I was part of the Tea Party before it was cool!\"She explained that the role of Americans for Prosperity was to help \"educate\" Tea Party activists on policy details, and to givethem \"next-step training\" after their rallies, so that their political energy could be channelled \"more effectively.\" And she notedthat Americans for Prosperity had provided Tea Party activists with lists of elected officials to target. She said of the Kochs,\"They're certainly our people. David's the chairman of our board. I've certainly met with them, and I'm very appreciative ofwhat they do.\"Venable honored several Tea Party \"citizen leaders\" at the summit. The Texas branch of Americans for Prosperity gave itsBlogger of the Year Award to a young woman named Sibyl West. On June 14th, West, writing on her site, described Obama asthe \"cokehead in chief.\" In an online thread, West speculated that the President was exhibiting symptoms of \"demonicpossession (aka schizophrenia, etc.).\" The summit featured several paid speakers, including Janine Turner, the actress bestknown for her role on the television series \"Northern Exposure.\" She declared, \"They don't want our children to know abouttheir rights. They don't want our children to know about a God!\"During a catered lunch, Venable introduced Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general of Texas, who told the crowd that Obamawas \"the most radical President ever to occupy the Oval Office,\" and had hidden from voters a secret agendaâ\"the governmenttaking over our economy and our lives.\" Countering Obama, Cruz proclaimed, was \"the epic fight of our generation!\" As thecrowd rose to its feet and cheered, he quoted the defiant words of a Texan at the Alamo: \"Victory, or death!\"Americans for Prosperity has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception. In the weeks before thefirst Tax Day protests, in April, 2009, Americans for Prosperity hosted a Web site offering supporters \"Tea Party TalkingPoints.\" The Arizona branch urged people to send tea bags to Obama; the Missouri branch urged members to sign up for\"Taxpayer Tea Party Registration\" and provided directions to nine protests. The group continues to stoke the rebellion. TheNorth Carolina branch recently launched a \"Tea Party Finder\" Web site, advertised as \"a hub for all the Tea Parties in NorthCarolina.\"The anti-government fervor infusing the 2010 elections represents a political triumph for the Kochs. By giving money to\"educate,\" fund, and organize Tea Party protesters, they have helped turn their private agenda into a mass movement. BruceBartlett, a conservative economist and a historian, who once worked at the National Center for Policy Analysis, a Dallas-basedthink tank that the Kochs fund, said, \"The problem with the whole libertarian movement is that it's been all chiefs and noindians. There haven't been any actual people, like voters, who give a crap about it. So the problem for the Kochs has beentrying to create a movement.\" With the emergence of the Tea Party, he said, \"everyone suddenly sees that for the first time thereare Indians out thereâpeople who can provide real ideological power.\" The Kochs, he said, are \"trying to shape and control andchannel the populist uprising into their own policies.\".A Republican campaign consultant who has done research on behalf of Charles and David Koch said of the Tea Party, \"TheKoch brothers gave the money that founded it. It's like they put the seeds in the ground. Then the rainstorm comes, and thefrogs come out of the mudâand they're our candidates!\"The Kochs and their political operatives declined requests for interviews. Instead, a prominent New York public-relationsexecutive who is close with the Kochs put forward two friends: George Pataki, the former governor of New York, and MortimerZuckerman, the publisher and real-estate magnate. Pataki, a Republican who received campaign donations from David Koch,called him \"a patriot who cares deeply about his country.\" Zuckerman praised David's \"gentle decency\" and the \"range of hispublic interests.\"The Republican campaign consultant said of the family's political activities, \"To call them under the radar is anunderstatement. They are underground!\" Another former Koch adviser said, \"They're smart. This right-wing, redneck stuffworks for them. They see this as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves.\" Rob Stein, a Democratic politicalstrategist who has studied the conservative movement's finances, said that the Kochs are \"at the epicenter of the anti-Obamamovement. But it's not just about Obama. They would have done the same to Hillary Clinton. They did the same with BillClinton. They are out to destroy progressivism.\"ddly enough, the fiercely capitalist Koch family owes part of its fortune to Joseph Stalin. Fred Koch was the son of a Dutchprinter who settled in Texas and ran a weekly newspaper. Fred attended M.I.T., where he earned a degree in chemicalengineering. In 1927, he invented a more efficient process for converting oil into gasoline, but, according to family lore,America's major oil companies regarded him as a threat and shut him out of the industry. Unable to succeed at home, Kochfound work in the Soviet Union. In the nineteen-thirties, his company trained Bolshevik engineers and helped Stalin's regimeset up fifteen modern oil refineries. Over time, however, Stalin brutally purged several of Koch's Soviet colleagues. Koch wasdeeply affected by the experience, and regretted his collaboration. He returned to the U.S. In the headquarters of his company,Rock Island Oil & Refining, in Wichita, he kept photographs aimed at proving that some of those Soviet refineries had beendestroyed in the Second World War. Gus diZerega, a former friend of Charles Koch, recalled, \"As the Soviets became astronger military power, Fred felt a certain amount of guilt at having helped build them up. I think it bothered him a lot.\"In 1958, Fred Koch became one of the original members of the John Birch Society, the arch-conservative group known, inpart, for a highly skeptical view of governance and for spreading fears of a Communist takeover. Members considered PresidentDwight D. Eisenhower to be a Communist agent. In a self-published broadside, Koch claimed that \"the Communists haveinfiltrated both the Democrat and Republican Parties.\" He wrote admiringly of Benito Mussolini's suppression of Cominmunistsin Italy, and disparagingly of the American civil-rights movement. \"The colored man looms large in the Communist plan to takeover America,\" he warned. Welfare was a secret plot to attract rural blacks to cities, where they would foment \"a vicious racewar.\" In a 1963 speech that prefigures the Tea Party's talk of a secret socialist plot, Koch predicted that Communists would\"infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the President is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.\"Koch married Mary Robinson, the daughter of a Missouri physician, and they had four sons: Freddie, Charles, and twins,David and William. John Damgard, the president of the Futures Industry Association, was David's schoolmate and friend. Herecalled that Fred Koch was \"a real John Wayne type.\" Koch emphasized rugged pursuits, taking his sons big-game hunting inAfrica, and requiring them to do farm labor at the family ranch. The Kochs lived in a stone mansion on a large compound acrossfrom Wichita's country club; in the summer, the boys could hear their friends splashing in the pool, but they were not allowedto join them. \"By instilling a work ethic in me at an early age, my father did me a big favor, although it didn't seem like a favorback then,\" Charles has written. \"By the time I was eight, he made sure work occupied most of my spare time.\" David Kochrecalled that his father also indoctrinated the boys politically. \"He was constantly speaking to us children about what was wrongwith government,\" he told Brian Doherty, an editor of the libertarian magazine Reason, and the author of \"Radicals forCapitalism,\" a 2007 history of the libertarian movement. \"It's something I grew up withâa fundamental point of view that biggovernment was bad, and imposition of government controls on our lives and economic fortunes was not good.\"David attended Deerfield Academy, in Massachusetts, and Charles was sent to military school. Charles, David, and Williamall earned engineering degrees at their father's alma mater, M.I.T., and later joined the family company. Charles eventuallyassumed control, with David as his deputy; William's career at the company was less successful. Freddie went to Harvard andstudied playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. His father reportedly disapproved of him, and punished him financially.(Freddie, through a spokesperson, denied this.)In 1967, after Fred Koch died, of a heart attack, Charles renamed the business Koch Industries, in honor of his father. FredKoch's will made his sons extraordinarily wealthy. David Koch joked about his good fortune in a 2003 speech to alumni atDeerfield, where, after pledging twenty-five million dollars, he was made the school's sole \"lifetime trustee.\" He said, \"Youmight ask: How does David Koch happen to have the wealth to be so generous? Well, let me tell you a story. It all started whenI was a little boy. One day, my father gave me an apple. I soon sold it for five dollars and bought two apples and sold them forten. Then I bought four apples and sold them for twenty. Well, this went on day after day, week after week, month after month,year after year, until my father died and left me three hundred million dollars!\"David and Charles had absorbed their father's conservative politics, but they did not share all his views, according todiZerega, who befriended Charles in the mid-sixties, after meeting him while browsing in a John Birch Society bookstore inWichita. Charles eventually invited him to the Kochs' mansion, to participate in an informal political-discussion group. \"It waspretty clear that Charles thought some of the Birch Society was bullshit,\" diZerega recalled.DiZerega, who has lost touch with Charles, eventually abandoned right-wing views, and became a political-scienceprofessor. He credits Charles with opening his mind to political philosophy, which set him on the path to academia; Charles isone of three people to whom he dedicated his first book. But diZeregÄ believes that the Koch brothers have followed a waywardintellectual trajectory, transferring their father's paranoia about Soviet Communism to a distrust of the U.S. government, andseeing its expansion, beginning with the New Deal, as a tyrannical threat to freedom. In an essay, posted on Beliefnet, diZeregwrites, \"As state socialism failed . . . the target for many within these organizations shifted to any kind of regulation at all.*Socialism' kept being defined downwards.\"Members of the John Birch Society developed an interest in a school of Austrian economists who promoted free-marketideals. Charles and David Koch were particularly influenced by the work of Friedrich von Hayek, the author of \"The Road toSerfdom\" (1944), which argued that centralized government planning led, inexorably, to totalitarianism. Hayek's belief inunfettered capitalism has proved inspirational to many conservatives, and to anti-Soviet dissidents; lately, Tea Party supportershave championed his work. In June, the talk-radio host Glenn Beck, who has supported the Tea Party rebellion, promoted \"TheRoad to Serfdom\" on his show; the paperback soon becaine a No. I best-seller on Amazon. (Beck appears to be a fan of theKochs; in the midst of a recent on-air parody of Al Gore, Beck said, without explanation, \"I want to thank Charles Koch for thisinformation.\" Beck declined to elaborate on the relationship.)Charles and David also became devotees of a more radical thinker, Robert LeFevre, who favored the abolition of the statebut didn't like the label \"anarchist\"; he called himself an \"autarchist.\" LeFevre liked to say that \"government is a diseasemasquerading as its own cure.\" In 1956, he opened an institution called the Freedom School, in Colorado Springs. BrianDoherty, of Reason, told me that \"LeFevre was an anarchist figure who won Charles's heart,\" and that the school was \"a tinyworld of people who thought the New Deal was a horrible mistake.\" According to diZerega, Charles supported the schoolfinancially, and even gave him money to take classes there.Throughout the seventies, Charles and David continued to build Koch Industries. In 1980, William, with assistance fromFreddie, attempted to take over the company from Charles, who, they felt, had assumed autocratic control. In retaliation, thecompany's board, which answered to Charles, fired William. (\"Charles runs it all with an iron hand,\" Bruce Bartlett, theeconomist, told me.) Lawsuits were filed, with William and Freddie on one side and Charles and David on the other. In 1983,Charles and David bought out their brothers' share in the company for nearly a billion dollars. But the antagonism remained,and litigation continued for seventeen more years, with the brothers hiring rival private investigators; in 1990, they walked pastone another with stony expressions at their mother's funeral. Eventually, Freddie moved to Monaco, which has no income tax.He bought historic estates in France, Austria, and elsewhere, filling them with art, antiques, opera scores, and literarymanuscripts. William founded his own energy company, Oxbow, and turned to yachting; he spent an estimated sixty-fivemillion dollars to win the America's Cup, in 1992.With Charles as the undisputed chairman and C.E.O., Koch Industries expanded rapidly. Roger Altman, who heads theinvestment-banking firm Evercore, told me that the company's performance has been \"beyond phenomenal.\" Charles remainedin Wichita, with his wife and two children, guarding his privacy while supporting community charities. David moved to NewYork City, where he is an executive vice-president of the company and the C.E.O. of its Chemical Technology Group. Afinancial expert who knows Koch Industries well told me. \"Charles is the company. Charles runs it.\" David, described byassociates as \"affable\" and \"a bit of a lunk,\" enjoyed for years the life of a wealthy bachelor. He rented a yacht in the South ofFrance and bought a waterfront home in Southampton, where he threw parties that the Web site New York Social Diary likenedto an \"East Coast version of Hugh Hefner's soirÃ©es.\" In 1996, he married Julia Flesher, a fashion assistant. They live in a nine-thousand-square-foot duplex at 740 Park Avenue, with their three children. Though David's manner is more cosmopolitan, andmore genial, than that of Charles, Brian Doherty, who has interviewed both brothers, couldn't think of a single issue on whichthe brothers disagreed.As their fortunes grew, Charles and David Koch became the primary underwriters of hard-line libertarian politics inAmerica. Charles's goal, as Doherty described it, was to tear the government \"out at the root.\" The brothers' first major publicstep came in 1979, when Charles persuaded David, then thirty-nine, to run for public office. They had become supporters of theLibertarian Party, and were backing its Presidential candidate, Ed Clark, who was running against Ronald Reagan from theright. Frustrated by the legal limits on campaign donations, they contrived to place David on the ticket, in the Vice-Presidentialslot; upon becoming a candidate, he could lavish as much of his personal fortune as he wished on the campaign. The ticket'sslogan was \"The Libertarian Party has only one source of funds: You.\" In fact, its primary source of funds was David Koch,who spent more than two million dollars on the effort.Many of the ideas propounded in the 1980 campaign presaged the Tea Party movement. Ed Clark told The Nation thatlibertarians were getting ready to stage \"a very big tea party,\" because people were \"sick to death\" of taxes. The LibertarianParty platform called for the abolition of the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., as well as of federal regulatory agencies, such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Energy. The Party wanted to end Social Security, minimum-wagelaws, gun control, and all personal and corporate income taxes; it proposed the legalization of prostitution, recreational drugs,and suicide. Government should be reduced to only one function: the protection of individual rights. William F. Buckley, Jr., amore traditional conservative, called the movement \"Anarcho-Totalitarianism.\"That November, the Libertarian ticket received only one per cent of the vote. The brothers realized that their brand ofpolitics didn't sell at the ballot box. Charles Koch became openly scornful of conventional politics. \"It tends to be a nasty,corrupting business,\" he told a reporter at the time. \"I'm interested in advancing libertarian ideas.\" According to Doherty'sbook, the Kochs came to regard elected politicians as merely \"actors playing out a script.\" A longtime confidant of the Kochstold Doherty that the brothers wanted to \"supply the themes and words for the scripts.\" In order to alter the direction ofAmerica, they had to \"influence the areas where policy ideas percolate from: academia and think tanks.\"fter the 1980 election, Charles and David Koch receded from the public arena. But they poured more than a hundred milliondollars into dozens of seemingly independent organizations. Tax records indicate that in 2008 the three main Koch familyfoundations gave money to thirty-four political and policy organizations, three of which they founded, and several of whichthey direct. The Kochs and their company have given additional millions to political campaigns, advocacy groups, andlobbyists. The family's subterranean financial role has fuelled suspicion on the left: Lee Fang, of the liberal blog ThinkProgress,has called the Kochs \"the billionaires behind the hate.\"Only the Kochs know precisely how much they have spent on politics. Public tax records show that between 1998 and 2008the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than forty-eight million dollars. The Claude R. Lambe CharitableFoundation, which is controlled by Charles Koch and his wife, along with two company employees and an accountant, spentmore than twenty-eight million. The David H. Koch Charitable Foundation spent more than a hundred and twenty million.Meanwhile, since 1998 Koch Industries has spent more than fifty million dollars on lobbying. Separately, the company'spolitical-action committee, KochPAC, has donated some eight million dollars to political campaigns, more than eightyper cent of it to Republicans. So far in 2010, Koch Industries leads all other energy companies in politicalcontributions, as it has since 2006. In addition, during the past dozen years the Kochs and other family membershave personally spent more than two million dollars on political contributions. In the second quarter of 2010, DavidKoch was the biggest individual contributor to the Republican Governors Association, with a million-dollar donation.Other gifts by the Kochs may be untraceable; federal tax law permits anonymous personal donations to politicallyactive nonprofit groups.In recent decades, members of several industrial dynasties have spent parts of their fortunes on a conservative agenda. Inthe nineteen-eighties. the Olin family, which owns a chemicals-and-manufacturing conglomerate, became known for fundingright-leaning thinking in academia, particularly in law schools. And during the nineties Richard Mellon Scaife, a descendant ofAndrew Mellon, spent millions attempting to discredit President Bill Clinton. Ari Rabin-Havt, a vice-president at theDemocratic-leaning Web site Media Matters, said that the Kochs' effort is unusual, in its marshalling of corporate and personalfunds: \"Their role, in terms of financial commitments, is staggering.\"Of course, Democrats give money, too. Their most prominent donor, the financier George Soros, runs a foundation, theOpen Society Institute, that has spent as much as a hundred million dollars a year in America. Soros has also made generousprivate contributions to various Democratic campaigns, including Obama's. But Michael Vachon, his spokesman, argued thatSoros's giving is transparent, and that \"none of his contributions are in the service of his own economic interests.â The Kochshave given millions of dollars to nonprofit groups that criticize environmental regulation and support lower taxes for industry.Gus diZerega, the former friend, suggested that the Kochs' youthful idealism about libertarianism had largely devolved into arationale for corporate self-interest. He said of Charles, \"Perhaps he has confused making money with freedom.\"Some critics have suggested that the Kochs' approach has subverted the purpose of tax-exempt giving. By law, charitablefoundations must conduct exclusively nonpartisan activities that promote the public welfare. A 2004 report by the NationalCommittee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group, described the Kochs' foundations as being self-serving,concluding, \"These foundations give money to nonprofit organizations that do research and advocacy on issues that impact theprofit margin of Koch Industries.\"The Kochs have gone well beyond their immediate self-interest, however, funding organizations that aim to push thecountry in a libertarian direction. Among the institutions that they have subsidized are the Institute for Justice, which fileslawsuits opposing state and federal regulations; the Institute for Humane Studies, which underwrites libertarian academics; andthe Bill of Rights Institute, which promotes a conservative slant on the Constitution. Many of the organizations funded by theKochs employ specialists who write position papers that are subsequently quoted by politicians and pundits. David Koch hasacknowledged that the family exerts tight ideological control. \"If we're going to give a lot of money, we'll make darn sure theyspend it in a way that goes along with our intent,\" he told Doherty. \"And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things wedon't agree with, we withdraw funding.\"he Kochs' subsidization of a pro-corporate movement fulfills, in many ways, the vision laid out in a secret 1971 memo thatLewis Powell, then a Virginia attorney, wrote two months before he was nominated to the Supreme Court. The antiwarmovement had turned its anger on defense contractors, such as Dow Chemical, and Ralph Nader was leading a public-interestcrusade against corporations. Powell, writing a report for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, urged American companies to fightback. The greatest threat to free enterprise, he warned, was not Communism or the New Left but, rather, \"respectable elementsof society\"âintellectuals, journalists, and scientists. To defeat them, he wrote, business leaders needed to wage a long-term,unified campaign to change public opinion.Charles Koch seems to have approached both business and politics with the deliberation of an engineer. \"To bring aboutsocial change,\" he told Doherty, requires \"a strategy\" that is \"vertically and horizontally integrated,\" spanning \"from ideacreation to policy development to education to grassroots organizations to lobbying to political action.\" The project,he admitted, was extremely ambitious. \"We have a radical philosophy,\" he said.In 1977, the Kochs provided the funds to launch the nation's first libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute. According to theCenter for Public Integrity, between 1986 and 1993 the Koch family gave eleven million dollars to the institute. Today, Catohas more than a hundred full-time employees, and its experts and policy papers are widely quoted and respected by themainstream media. It describes itself as nonpartisan, and its scholars have at times been critical of both parties. But it hasconsistently pushed for corporate tax cuts, reductions in social services, and laissez-faire environmental policies.When President Obama, in a 2008 speech, described the science on global warming as \"beyond dispute,\" the Cato Institutecame out a full-page ad in the Times to contradict him. Cato's resident scholars have relentlessly criticized political attempts tostop global warming as expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary. Ed Crane, the Cato Institute's founder and president, told methat \"global-warming theories give the government more control of the economy.\"Cato scholars have been particularly energetic in promoting the Climategate scandal. Last year, private e-mails of climatescientists at the University of East Anglia, in England, were mysteriously leaked, and their exchanges appeared to suggest awillingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming is real. In the two weeks after the e-mails wentpublic, one Cato scholar gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the alleged scandal. But five independent inquirieshave since exonerated the researchers, and nothing was found in their e-mails or data to discredit the scientific consensus onglobal warming.Nevertheless, the controversy succeeded in spreading skepticism about climate change. Even though the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration recently issued a report concluding that the evidence for global warming is unequivocal, moreAmericans are convinced than at any time since 1997 that scientists have exaggerated the seriousness of global warming. TheKochs promote this statistic on their company's Web site but do not mention the role that their funding has played in fosteringsuch doubt.In a 2002 memo, the Republican political consultant Frank Luntz wrote that so long as \"voters believe there is no consensusabout global warming within the scientific community\" the status quo would prevail. The key for opponents of environmentalreform, he said, was to question the scienceâa public-relations strategy that the tobacco industry used effectively for years toforestall regulation. The Kochs have funded many sources of environmental skepticism, such as the Heritage Foundation, whichhas argued that \"scientific facts gathered in the past 10 years do not support the notion of catastrophic human-made warming.\"The brothers have given money to more obscure groups, too, such as the Independent Women's Forum, which opposes thepresentation of global warming as a scientific fact in American public schools. Until 2008, the group was run by NancyPfotenhauer, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries. Mary Beth Jarvis, a vice-president of a Koch subsidiary, is on the group'sboard.Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California, San Diego, is the co-author of\"Merchants of Doubt,\" a new book that chronicles various attempts by American industry to manipulate public opinion onscience. She noted that the Kochs, as the heads of \"a company with refineries and pipelines,\" have \"a lot at stake.\" She added,\"If the answer is to phase out fossil fuels, a different group of people are going to be making money, so we shouldn't besurprised that they're fighting tooth and nail.\"David Koch told New York that he was unconvinced that global warming has been caused by human activity. Even if it hasbeen, he said, the heating of the planet will be beneficial, resulting in longer growing seasons in the Northern Hemisphere. \"TheEarth will be able to support enormously more people because far greater land area will be available to produce food,\" he said.n the mid-eighties, the Kochs provided millions of dollars to George Mason University, in Arlington, Virginia, to set up anotherthink tank. Now known as the Mercatus Center, it promotes itself as \"the world's premier university source for market-orientedideasâbridging the gap between academic ideas and real-world problems.\" Financial records show that the Koch familyfoundations have contributed more than thirty million dollars to George Mason, much of which has gone to the MercatusCenter, a nonprofit organization. \"It's ground zero for deregulation policy in Washington,\" Rob Stein, the Democratic strategist,said. It is an unusual arrangement. \"George Mason is a public university, and receives public funds,\" Stein noted. \"Virginia ishosting an institution that the Kochs practically control.\"The founder of the Mercatus Center is Richard Fink, formerly an economist. Fink heads Koch Industries' lobbyingoperation in Washington. In addition, he is the president of the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the president of theClaude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation, a director of the Fred C. and Mary R. Koch Foundation, and a director and co-founder, with David Koch, of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation.Fink, with his many titles, has become the central nervous system of the Kochtopus. He appears to have supplanted EdCrane, the head of the Cato Institute, as the brothers' main political lieutenant. Though David remains on the board at Cato,Charles Koch has fallen out with Crane. Associates suggested to me that Crane had been insufficiently respectful of Charles'smanagement philosophy, which he distilled into a book called \"The Science of Success,\" and trademarked under the nameMarket-Based Management, or M.B.M. In the book, Charles recommends instilling a company's corporate culture with thecompetitiveness of the marketplace. Koch describes M.B.M. as a \"holistic system\" containing \"five dimensions: vision, virtueand talents, knowledge processes, decision rights and incentives.\" A top Cato Institute official told me that Charles \"thinks he'sa genius. He's the emperor, and he's convinced he's wearing clothes.\" Fink, by contrast, has been far more embracing ofCharles's ideas. (Fink, like the Kochs, declined to be interviewed.)At a 1995 confererice for philanthropists, Fink adopted the language of economics when speaking about the MercatusCenter's purpose. He said that grant-makers should use think tanks and political-action groups to convert intellectual rawmaterials into policy \"products.\"The Wall Street Journal has called the Mercatus Center \"the most important think tank you've never heard of,\" and notedthat fourteen of the twenty-three regulations that President George W. Bush placed on a \"hit list\" had been suggested first byMercatus scholars. Fink told the paper that the Kochs have \"other means of fighting [their] battles,\" and that the MercatusCenter does not actively promote the cornpany's private interests. But Thomas McGarity, a law professor at the University ofTexas, who specializes in environmental issues, told me that \"Koch has been constantly in trouble with the E.P.A., andMercatus has constantly haimmered on the agency.\" An environmental lawyer who has clashed with the Mercatus Center calledit \"a means of laundering economic aims.\" The lawyer explained the strategy: \"You take corporate money and give it to aneutral-sounding think tank,\" which \"hires people with pedigrees and academic degrees who put out credible-seeming studies.But they all coincide perfectly with the economic interests of their funders.\"In 1997, for instance, the E.P.A. moved to reduce surface ozone, a form of pollution caused, in part, by emissions from oilrefineries. Susan Dudley, an economist who became a top official at the Mercatus Center, criticized the proposed rule. TheE.P.A., she argued, had not taken into account that smog-free skies would result in more cases of skin cancer. She projected thatif pollution were controlled it would cause up to eleven thousand additional cases of skin cancer each year.In 1999, the District of Columbia Circuit Court took up Dudley's smog argument. Evaluating the E.P.A. rule, the courtfound that the E.P.A. had \"explicitly disregarded\" the \"possible health benefits of ozone.\" In another part of the opinion, thecourt ruled, 2-1, that the E.P.A. had overstepped its authority in calibrating standards for ozone emissions. As the ConstitutionalAccountability Center, a think tank, revealed, the judges in the majority had previously attended legal junkets, on a Montanaranch, that were arranged by the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environmentâa group funded by Koch familyfoundations. The judges have claimed that the ruling was unaffected by their attendance.deas don't happen on their own,\" Matt Kibbe, the president of Freedom Works, a Tea Party advocacy group, told me.\"Throughout history, ideas need patrons.\" The Koch brothers, after helping to create Cato and Mercatus, concluded that thinktanks alone were not enough to effect change. They needed a mechanism to deliver those ideas to the street, and to attract thepublic's support. In 1984, David Koch and Richard Fink created yet another organization. and Kibbe joined them. The group,Citizens for a Sound Economy, seemed like a grassroots movement, but according to the Center for Public Integrity it wassponsored principally by the Kochs, who provided $7.9 million between 1986 and 1993. Its mission, Kibbe said, \"was to takethese heavy ideas and translate them for mass America. . . . We read the same literature Obama did about nonviolentrevolutionsâSaul Alinsky, Gandhi, Martin Luther King. We studied the idea of the Boston Tea Party as an example ofnonviolent social change. We learned we needed boots on the ground to sell ideas, not candidates.\" Within a few years, thegroup had mobilized fifty paid field workers, in twenty-six states, to rally voters behind the Kochs' agenda. David and Charles,according to one participant, were \"very controlling, very top down. You can't build an organization with them. They run it.\"Around this time, the brothers faced a political crisis. In 1989, the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs investigatedtheir business and released a scathing report accusing Koch Oil of \"a widespread and sophisticated scheme to steal crude oilfrom Indians and others through fraudulent mismeasuring.\" The Kochs admitted that they had improperly taken thirty-onemillion dollars' worth of crude oil, but said that it had been accidental. Charles Koch told committee investigators that oilmeasurement is \"a very uncertain art.\"To defend its reputation, Koch Industries hired Robert Strauss, then a premier Washington lobbyist; the company soonopened an office in the city. A grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations, but it eventually disbanded, withoutissuing criminal charges. According to the Senate report, after the committee hearings Koch operatives delved into the personallives of committee staffers, even questioning an ex-wife. Senate investigators were upset by the Kochs' tactics. Kenneth Ballen,the counsel to the Senate committee, said, \"These people have amassed such unaccountable power!\"By 1993, when Bill Clinton became President, Citizens for a Sound Economy had become a prototype for the kind ofcorporate-backed opposition campaigns that have proliferated during the Obama era. The group waged a successful assault onClinton's proposed B.T.U. tax on energy, for instance, running advertisements, staging inedia events, and targeting opponents.And it mobilized anti-tax rallies outside the Capitolârallies that NPR described as \"designed to strike fear into the hearts ofwavering Democrats.\" Dan Glickman, a former Democratic congressman from Wichita, who supported the B.T.U. tax, recalled,\"I'd been in Congress eighteen years. The Kochs actually engaged against me and funded my opponent. They used a lot ofresources and effortâtheir employees, too.\" Glickman suffered a surprise defeat. \"I can't prove it, but I think I was probablytheir victim,\" he said.The Kochs continued to disperse their money, creating slippery organizations with generic-sounding names, and this madeit difficult to ascertain the extent of their influence in Washington. In 1990, Citizens for a Sound Economy created a spinoffgroup, Citizens for the Environment, which called acid rain and other environmental problems \"myths.\" When thePittsburgh Post-Gazette investigated the matter, it discovered that the spinoff group had \"no citizen membership of its own.\"In 1997, another Senate investigation began looking into what a minority report called \"an audacious plan to pour millionsof dollars in contributions into Republican campaigns nationwide without disclosing the amount or source,\" in order to evadecampaign-finance laws. A shell corporation, Triad Management, had paid more than three million dollars for attack ads intwenty-six House races and three Senate races. More than half of the advertising money came from an obscure nonprofit group,the Economic Education Trust. The Senate cominittee's minority report suggested that \"the trust was financed in whole or inpart by Charles and David Koch of Wichita, Kansas.\" The brothers were suspected of having secretly paid for the attack ads,most of which aired in states where Koch Industries did business. In Kansas, where Triad Management was especially active,the funds may have played a decisive role in four of six federal races. The Kochs, when asked by reporters if they had given themoney, refused to comment. In 1998, however, the Wall Street Journal confirmed that a consultant on the Kochs' payroll hadbeen involved in the scheme. Charles Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, described the scandal as \"historic. Triad was thefirst time a major corporation used a cutout\"âa front operationâ\"in a threatening way. Koch Industries was the poster child ofa company run amok.\"uring the Clinton Administration, the energy industry faced increased scrutiny and regulation. In the mid-nineties, the JusticeDepartment filed two lawsuits against Koch Industries, claiming that it was responsible for more than three hundred oil spills,which had released an estimated three million gallons of oil into lakes and rivers. The penalty was potentially as high as twohundred and fourteen million dollars. In a settlement. Koch Industries paid a record thirty-million-dollar civil fine, and agreed tospend five million dollars on environmental projects.In 1999, a jury found Koch Industries guilty of negligence and malice in the deaths of two Texas teen-agers in an explosionthat resulted from a leaky underground butane pipeline. (In 2001, the company paid an undisclosed settlement.) And in the finalmonths of the Clinton Presidency the Justice Department levelled a ninety-seven-count indictment against the company, forcovering up the discharge of ninety-one tons of benzene, a carcinogen, from its refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas. The companywas liable for three hundred and fifty million dollars in fines, and four Koch employees faced up to thirty-five years in prison.The Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to one criminal charge of covering up environmental violations, includingthe falsification of documents, and paid a twenty-million-dollar fine. David UhlÄ±nann, a career prosecutor who, at the time,headed the environmental-crimes section at the Justice Department, described the suit as \"one of the most significant cases everbrought under the Clean Air Act.\" He added, \"Environmental crimes are almost always motivated by economics and arrogance,and in the Koch case there was a healthy dose of both.\"During the 2000 election campaign, Koch Industries spent some nine hundred thousand dollars to support the candidaciesof George W. Bush and other Republicans. During the Bush years, Koch Industries and other fossil-fuel companies enjoyedremarkable prosperity. The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed the Dick Cheney Lobbyist Energy Bill, offeredenormous subsidies and tax breaks for energy companies. The Kochs have cast themselves as deficit hawks, but, according to astudy by Media Matters, their companies have benefitted from nearly a hundred million dollars in government contracts since2000.In 2004, Citizens for a Sound Economy was accused of illegitimately throwing its weight behind Bush's reÃ«lection. Thegroup's Oregon branch had attempted to get Ralph Nader on the Presidential ballot, in order to dilute Democratic support forJohn Kerry. Critics argued that it was illegal for a tax-exempt nonprofit organization to donate its services for partisan politicalpurposes. (A complaint was filed with the Federal Election Commission; it was dismissed.)That year, internal rivalries at Citizens for a Sound Economy caused the organization to split apart. David Koch and Finkstarted a new group, Americans for Prosperity, and they hired Tim Phillips to run it. Phillips was a political veteran who hadworked with Ralph Reed, the evangelical leader and Republican activist, co-founding Century Strategies, a campaign-consulting company that became notorious for its ties to the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Phillips's online biographydescribes him as an expert in \"grasstops\" and \"grassroots\" political organizing. The Kochs' choice of Phillips signalled an evengreater toughness. The conservative operative Grover Norquist, who is known for praising \"throat slitters\" in politics, calledPhillips \"a grownup who can make things happen.\"Last year, Phillips told the Financial Times that Americans for Prosperity had only eight thousand registered members.Currently, its Web site claims that the group has \"1.2 million activists.\" Whatever its size, the Kochs' political involvement hasbeen intense; a former employee of the Cato Institute told me that Americans for Prosperity \"was micromanaged by the Kochs.\"And the brothers' investment may well have paid off: Americans for Prosperity, in concert with the family's otherorganizations, has been instrumental in disrupting the Obama Presidency.In January, 2008, Charles Koch wrote in his company newsletter that America could be on the verge of \"the greatest loss ofliberty and prosperity since the 1930s.\" That October, Americans for Prosperity held a conference of conservative operatives atÃ  Marriott hotel outside Washington. Erick Erickson, the editor-in-chief of the conservative blog RedState.com, took the lectern,thanked David Koch, and vowed to \"unite and fight . . . the armies of the left!\" Soon after Obama assumed office, Americansfor Prosperity launched \"Porkulus\" rallies against Obama's stimulus-spending measures. Then the Mercatus Center released areport claiming that stimulus funds had been directed disproportionately toward Democratic districts; eventually, the author wasforced to correct the report, but not before Rush Limbaugh, citing the paper, had labelled Obama's program \"a slush fund,\" andFox News and other conservative outlets had echoed the sentiment. (Phil Kerpen, the vice-president for policy at Americans forProsperity, is a contributor to the Fox News Web site. Another officer at Americans for Prosperity, Walter Williams, oftenguest-hosts for Limbaugh.)Americans for Prosperity also created an offshoot, Patients United Now, which organized what Phillips has estimated to bemore than three hundred rallies against health-care reforÄ±n. At one rally, an effigy of a Democratic congressman was hung; atanother, protesters unfurled a banner depicting corpses frorn Dachau. The group also helped organize the \"Kill the Bill\" protestsoutside the Capitol, in March, where Democratic supporters of health-care reform alleged that they were spat on and cursed at.Phillips was a featured speaker.Americans for Prosperity has held at least eighty events targeting cap-and-trade legislation, which is aimed at makingindustries pay for the air pollution that they create. Speakers for the group claimed, with exaggeration, that even back-yardbarbecues and kitchen stoves would be taxed. The group was also involved in the attacks on Obama's \"green jobs\" czar, VanJones, and waged a crusade against international climate talks. Casting his group as a champion of ordinary workers who wouldbe hurt by environmentalists, Phillips went to Copenhagen last year and staged a protest outside the United Nations conferenceon climate change, declaring, \"We're a grassroots organization. . . . I think it's unfortunate when wealthy children of wealthyfamilies . . . want to send unemployment rates in the United States up to twenty per cent.\"Grover Norquist, who holds a weekly meeting for conservative leaders in Washington, including representatives fromAmericans for Prosperity, told me that last summer's raucous rallies were pivotal in undermining Obama's agenda. TheRepublican leadership in Congress, he said, \"couldn't have done it without August, when people went out on the streets. Itdiscouraged deal-makers\"âRepublicans who might otherwise have worked constructively with Obama. Moreover, theappearance of growing public opposition to Obama affected corporate donors on K Street. \"K Street is a three-billion-dollarweathervane,\" Norquist said. \"When Obama was strong, the Chamber of Commerce said, 'We can work with the ObainaAdministration. But that changed when thousands of people went into the street and 'terrorized' congressimen. August is whatchanged it. Now that Obama is weak, people are getting tough.\"As the first anniversary of Obama's election approached, David Koch came to the Washington area to attend a triuinphantAmericans for Prosperity gathering. Obama's poll numbers were falling fast. Not a single Republican senator was working withthe Administration on health care, or much else. Pundits were writing about Obama's political ineptitude, and Tea Party groupswere accusing the President of initiating \"a government takeover.\" In a speech, Koch said, \"Days like today bring to reality thevision of our board of directors when we started this organization, five years ago.\" He went on, \"We envisioned a massmovement, a state-based one, but national in scope, of hundreds of thousands of American citizens from all walks of lifestanding up and fighting for the economic freedoms that made our nation the most prosperous society in history. . . . Thankfully,the stirrings from California to Virginia, and from Texas to Michigan, show that more and more of our fellow-citizens arebeginning to see the same truths as we do.\"While Koch didn't explicitly embrace the Tea Party movement that day, more recently he has coine close to doing so,praising it for demonstrating the \"powerful visceral hostility in the body politic against the massive increase in governmentpower, the massive efforts to socialize this country.\" Charles Koch, in a newsletter sent to his seventy thousand employees,compared the Obama Administration to the regime of the Venezuelan strongman Hugo ChÃ¡vez. The Kochs' sense ofimperilment is somewhat puzzling. Income inequality in America is greater than it has been since the nineteen-twenties, andsince the seventies the tax rates of the wealthiest have fallen more than those of the middle class. Yet the brothers' message hasevidently resonated with voters: a recent poll found that fifty-five per cent of Americans agreed that Obama is a socialist.Americans for Prosperity, meanwhile, has announced that it will spend an additional forty-five million dollars before themidterm elections, in November. Although the group is legally prohibited from directly endorsing candidates, it nonethelessplans to target some fifty House races and half a dozen Senate races, staging rallies, organizing door-to-door canvassing, andrunning ads aimed at \"educating voters about where candidates stand.\"Though the Kochs have slowed Obama's momentum, their larger political battle is far from won. Richard Fink, interviewedby FrumForum.com this spring, said, \"If you look at where we've gone from the year 2000 to now, with the expansion ofgovernment spending and a debt burden that threatens to bankrupt the country, it doesn't look very good at all.\" He went on, \"Itlooks like the infrastructure that was built and nurtured has not carried the day.\" He suggested that the Kochs needed \"to getmore into the practical, day-to-day issues of governing.\"n 1991, David Koch was badly injured in a plane crash in Los Angeles. He was the sole passenger in first class to survive. As hewas recovering, a routine physical exam led to the discovery of prostate cancer. Koch received treatment, settled down, started afamily, and reconsidered his life. As he told Portfolio, \"When you're the only one who survived in the front of the plane andeveryone else diedâyeah, you think, 'My God, the good Lord spared ine for some greater purpose.' My joke is that I've beenbusy ever since, doing all the good work I can think of, so He can have confidence in me.\"Koch began giving spectacularly large donations to the arts and sciences. And he became a patron of cancer research,focussing on prostate cancer. In addition to his gifts to Sloan-Kettering, he gave fifteen million dollars to New York-Presbyterian Hospital, a hundred and twenty-five million to M.I.T. for cancer research, twenty million to Johns HopkinsUniversity, and twenty-five million to the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston. In response to his generosity, Sloan-Kettering gave Koch its Excellence in Corporate Leadership Award. In 2004, President Bush named him to the National CancerAdvisory Board, which guides the National Cancer Institute.Koch's corporate and political roles, however, may pose conflicts of interest. For example, at the same time that DavidKoch has been casting himself as a champion in the fight against cancer, Koch Industries has been lobbying to prevent theE.P.A. from classifying formaldehyde, which the company produces in great quantities, as a \"known carcinogen\" in humans.Scientists have long known that formaldehyde causes cancer in rats, and several major scientific studies have concludedthat formaldehyde causes cancer in human beingsâincluding one published last year by the National Cancer Institute, onwhose advisory board Koch sits. The study tracked twenty-five thousand patients for an average of forty years; subjects exposedto higher amounts of formaldehyde had significantly higher rates of leukemia. These results helped lead an expert panel withinthe National Institutes of Health to conclude that formaldehyde should be categorized as a known carcinogen, and be strictlycontrolled by the government. Corporations have resisted regulations on formaldehyde for decades, however, and KochIndustries has been a large funder of members of Congress who have stymied the E.P.A., requiring it to defer new regulationsuntil more studies are completed.Koch Industries became a major producer of the chemical in 2005, after it bought Georgia-Pacific, the paper and wood-products company, for twenty-one billion dollars. Georgia-Pacific manufactures formaldehyde in its chemical division, and usesit to produce various wood products, such as plywood and laminates. Its annual production capacity for formaldehyde is 2.2billion pounds. Last December, Traylor Champion, Georgia-Pacific's vice-president of environmental affairs, sent a formalletter of protest to federal health authorities. He wrote that the company \"strongly disagrees\" with the N.I.H. panel's conclusionthat formaldehyde should be treated as a known human carcinogen. David Koch did not recuse himself from the NationalCancer Advisory Board, or divest himself of company stock, while his company was directly lobbying the government to keepformaldehyde on the market. (A board spokesperson said that the issue of formaldehyde had not come up.)James Huff, an associate director at the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences, a division of the N.I.H., toldme that it was \"disgusting\" for Koch to be serving on the National Cancer Advisory Board: \"It's just not good for public health.Vested interests should not be on the board.\" He went on, \"Those boards are very important. They're very influential as towhether N.C.I. goes into formaldehyde or not. Billions of dollars are involved in formaldehyde.\"Harold Varmus, the director of the National Cancer Institute, knows David Koch from Memorial Sloan-Kettering, which heused to run. He said that, at Sloan-Kettering, \"a lot of people who gave to us had large business interests. The one thing wewouldn't tolerate in our board members is tobacco.\" When told of Koch Industries' stance on formaldehyde, Varmus said thathe was \"surprised.\"he David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins, at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, is a multimediaexploration of the theory that mankind evolved in response to climate change. At the main entrance, viewers are confrontedwith a giant graph charting the Earth's temperature over the past ten million years, which notes that it is far cooler now than itwas ten thousand years ago. Overhead, the text reads, \"HUMANS EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO A CHANGING WORLD.\" Themessage, as amplified by the exhibit's Web site, is that \"key human adaptations evolved in response toenvironmental instability.\" Only at the end of the exhibit, under the headline \"OUR SURVIVAL CHALLENGE,â is it notedthat levels of carbon dioxide are higher now than they have ever been, and that they are projected to increasedramatically in the next century. No cause is given for this development; no mention is made of any possible roleplayed by fossil fuels. The exhibit makes it seem part of a natural continuum. The accompanying text says, \"Duringthe period in which humans evolved, Earth's temperature and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmospherefluctuated together.\" An interactive game in the exhibit suggests that humans will continue to adapt to climatechange in the future. People may build \"underground cities,\" developing \"short, compact bodies\" or \"curved spines,\"so that \"moving around in tight spaces will be no problem.\"Such ideas uncannily echo the Koch message. The company's January newsletter to employees, for instance, argues that\"fluctuations in the earth's climate predate humanity,\" and concludes, \"Since we can't control Mother Nature, let's figure outhow to get along with her changes.\" Joseph Romm, a physicist who runs the Web site ClirnateProgress.org, is infuriated by theSmithsonian's presentation. \"The whole exhibit whitewashes the modern climate issue,â he said. \"I think the Kochs wanted tobe seen as some sort of high-minded company, associated with the greatest natural-history and science museum in the country.But the truth is, the exhibit is underwritten by big-time polluters, who are underground funders of action to stop efforts to dealwith this threat to humanity. I think the Smithsonian should have drawn the line.\"CristiÃ¡n Samper, the museum's director, said that the exhibit is not about climate change, and described Koch as \"one of thebest donors we've had, in my tenure here, because he's very interested in the content, but completely hands off.\" He noted, âÐ¢don't know all the details of his involvement in other issues.\"The Kochs have long depended on the public's not knowing all the details about them. They have been content to operate whatDavid Koch has called \"the largest company that you've never heard of.\" But with the growing prominence of the Tea Party,and with increased awareness of the Kochs' ties to the movement, the brothers may find it harder to deflect scrutiny. Recently,President Obarna took aim at the Kochs' political network. Speaking at a Dernocratic National Cornmittee fund-raiser, inAustin, he warned supporters that the Supreme Court's recent ruling in the Citizens United caseâwhich struck down lawsprohibiting direct corporate spending on campaignsâhad made it even easier for big companies to hide behind \"groups withharmless-sounding names like Americans for Prosperity.\" Obama said, \"They don't have to say who, exactly, Americans forProsperity are. You don't know if it's a foreign-controlled corporation\"âor even, he added, \"a big oil company.\"",

    "text": "I expect this will get big play in the region. -Erin\n\nhttp://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/39692/fibi-netanyahu/\n\nFibi Netanyahu\nIn 2001, PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords\nBY LIEL LEIBOVITZ | Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM |\n\nMeeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. \"I believe Prime\nMinister Netanyahu wants peace,\" Obama said. \"I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.\"\n\nA newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a\nradically different light. In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having\nderailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to\n\"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable\" (all translations are\nmine).\n\nAccording to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be \"Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them,\nand distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.\"\n\nNetanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after\nstepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the\nPalestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the\nUnited States would let such an attack come to fruition.\n\n\"I know what America is,\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right\ndirection. They won't get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian,\" and\nwent on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would\nbe allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could\ntorpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that.\n\n\"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords],\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would, but ... I'm going\nto interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders.\nHow did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far\nas I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\"\n\nSmiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let\nIsrael alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"They didn't want to give\nme that letter,\" Netanyahu said, \"so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to\nthe Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing.' Only when the letter came, during that\nmeeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment\non, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords.\"\n\nPresident Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape\nonline here.\n\nErin Pelton | Deputy Spokesperson for Foreign Media | Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs | US Department of State\nt: (202) 647-4148 | | Email: PeltonE@state.gov",

His is an appropriately young face for an\nAmerican representative to the world's 1.6 billion Muslims, the majority of whom are younger than he is.\nAt a time when the United States is fighting two wars in Muslim nations and defending itself against an\nenduring terrorist threat, changing perceptions will take time. \"The challenge is to continue to communicate that\nthis is a long-term process,\" Hussain said. \"Sometimes the challenge becomes that people want to focus\nexclusively on the political issues, issues that this administration is working very diligently to solve.\"\nHussain's father, a mining engineer, moved from Bihar, India, to Wyoming in the late 1960s. A few years later,\nduring a visit to India, he married Hussain's mother, now an obstetrician in Plano.\nThe family prayed regularly in a mosque not far from the church-heavy city. At about the time he began middle\nschool, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, \"it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain.\" But\nhe said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and\nbasketball a passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his \"dream\" to play in one of Obama's\npickup games.\nHe graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to\npursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with\nRep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his\ndegree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,\n2001.\n\"I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin\ntowers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing whether there was a plane heading for the\nCapitol,\" he said. \"I very much experienced the terror on that day myself.\"\nIn the following days, he said, he experienced a \"whole set of feelings,\" from the initial fear of attack to worry\nabout discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of\npersecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.\n\"A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions\nthat Muslim communities have about the United States,\" he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim\nculture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said \"breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam.\" Isra\nBhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago\nBears fan.\nHussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a\nUniversity of South Florida professor, as \"politically motivated persecution.\" Arian was accused of aiding the\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the\ncharges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury\nacquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy.\n\"My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,\"\nHussain said. \"I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context.\"\nAfter the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow\nTar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media\nissues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.\nBen Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the\npresident's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American\nsociety and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays\ndaily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.\nHussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference\nat the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim\ncountries what \"America stands for,\" including through the partnerships.\n\"It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue,\" Hussain said. \"Our job will be to try to maximize\nour areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy.\"",

At about the time he began middle\nschool, the Persian Gulf War began and, as he recalled, \"it was not the easiest time to be named Hussain.\" But\nhe said he encountered very little religious persecution during a childhood that featured study, prayer and\nbasketball a passion he shares with the president. Hussain said it is his \"dream\" to play in one of Obama's\npickup games.\nHe graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, then enrolled at Harvard University to\npursue a master's degree in Arabic and Islamic studies. An internship after his first year of graduate school with\nRep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) cemented his interest in government, and he returned after completing his\ndegree to work on the House Judiciary Committee and was there on the morning of the attacks of Sept. 11,\n2001.\n\"I experienced firsthand being evacuated from the building, not knowing what was going on, seeing the twin\ntowers burning on TV as soon as I got into work, not knowing whether there was a plane heading for the\nCapitol,\" he said. \"I very much experienced the terror on that day myself.\"\nIn the following days, he said, he experienced a \"whole set of feelings,\" from the initial fear of attack to worry\nabout discrimination against American Muslims. He said he found that compassion, broader than the pockets of\npersecution, is often overlooked by Muslims here and abroad.\n\"A lot is made about American misperceptions about Muslim communities, but there's a lot of misperceptions\nthat Muslim communities have about the United States,\" he said. To counter such misunderstandings of Muslim\nculture, Hussain cited his wife, whom he said \"breaks down a lot of the misperceptions of women in Islam.\" Isra\nBhatty, a Yale Law School student currently on a Rhodes scholarship, wears the hijab and is an epic Chicago\nBears fan.\nHussain left Capitol Hill to attend Yale Law School. While there, he criticized the trial of Sami al-Arian, a\nUniversity of South Florida professor, as \"politically motivated persecution.\" Arian was accused of aiding the\nPalestinian Islamic Jihad movement, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Hussain, who did not criticize the\ncharges against Arian, was on a civil liberties panel with Arian's daughter when he made the comment. A jury\nacquitted Arian on some charges and deadlocked on others; he eventually pleaded guilty to one count of\nconspiracy.\n\"My extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms,\"\nHussain said. \"I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context.\"\nAfter the 2008 election, Hussain was recruited to the White House counsel's office by Cassandra Butts, a fellow\nTar Heel and Obama's former Harvard Law classmate. He has worked there on national security and new-media\nissues and helped inform the administration's Muslim outreach efforts.\nBen Rhodes, Obama's chief foreign policy speechwriter, sought Hussain's counsel last year as he drafted the\npresident's Cairo address. Hussain said his advice concerned the contributions Muslims have made to American\nsociety and the context behind some of the religious passages. Hussain has memorized the Koran. He prays\ndaily, often in a room in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building reserved for all faiths.\nHussain traveled in the Middle East after Obama announced his appointment during a Feb. 13 videoconference\nat the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, Qatar. His approach, Hussain said, will be to emphasize to Muslim\ncountries what \"America stands for,\" including through the partnerships.\n\"It's clear that we're not going to agree on every single issue,\" Hussain said. \"Our job will be to try to maximize\nour areas of agreement and work through our areas of disagreement and come to the best policy.\"",

About Us | Contact | Terms of Service | RSS A New Read on Jewish Life Fibi Netanyahu In 2001, PM boasted of manipulating Oslo accords By Liel Leibovitz | Jul 15, 2010 4:03 PM Netanyahu in 2001. CREDIT:munel 10 Meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu last week, President Obama could not have been more effusive. \"I believe Prime Minister Netanyahu wants peace,\" Obama sarg [11. \"I believe he is ready to take risks for peace.\" A newly revealed tape of Netanyahu in 2001, being interviewed while he thinks the cameras are off, shows him in a radically different light. In it, Netanyahu dismisses American foreign policy as easy to maneuver, boasts of having derailed the Oslo accords with political trickery, and suggests that the only way to deal with the Palestinians is to \"beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable\" (all translations are mine). According 121 to Haaretz's Gideon Levy, the video should be \"Banned for viewing by children so as not to corrupt them, and distributed around the country and the world so that everyone will know who leads the government of Israel.\" Netanyahu is speaking to a small group of terror victims in the West Bank settlement of Ofra two years after stepping down as prime minister in 1999. He appears laid-back. After claiming that the only way to deal with the Palestinian Authority was a large-scale attack, Netanyahu was asked by one of the participants whether or not the United States would let such an attack come to fruition. \"I know what America is,\" Netanyahu replied. \"America is a thing you can move very easily, move it in the right direction. They won't get in their way.\" He then called former president Bill Clinton \"radically pro-Palestinian,\" and went on to belittle the Oslo peace accords as vulnerable to manipulation. Since the accords state that Israel would be allowed to hang on to pre-defined military zones in the West Bank, Netanyahu told his hosts that he could torpedo the accords by defining vast swaths of land as just that. \"They asked me before the election if I'd honor [the Oslo accords],\" Netanyahu said. \"I said I would, but... I'm going to interpret the accords in such a way that would allow me to put an end to this galloping forward to the '67 borders. How did we do it? Nobody said what defined military zones were. Defined military zones are security zones; as far as I'm concerned, the entire Jordan Valley is a defined military zone. Go argue.\" Smiling, Netanyahu then recalled how he forced former U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher to agree to let Israei alone determine which parts of the West Bank were to be defined as military zones. \"They didn't want to give me that letter,\" Netanyahu said, \"so I didn't give them the Hebron agreement [the agreement giving Hebron back to the Palestinians]. I cut the cabinet meeting short and said, 'I'm not signing. Only when the letter came, during that meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I ratify the Hebron agreement. Why is this important? Because from that moment on, I de facto put an end to the Oslo accords.\" President Obama, and anyone else concerned about Israel's commitment to the peace process, may watch the tape online here [3] Related: Tricky Bibi [2] [Haaretz]",
